    "content": "Bonnets andbalaclavashave officially exited the quaint, oddball realms of fashion (respectively) and into the mainstream, quietly paving the way for another counterpart in thehead-warming business: the hooded scarf. Designers like Burberry, The Row, and Prada have been peddling their own versions of these hybrid accessories (one part balaclava, one part wraparoundscarf) that combine forces to keep your neck bundled up, your head insulated, and your outfits from falling flat. Other budget versions have sprung up, too, in cozy fabrics like fleece and mohair. And though the cold spells are beginning to reach their seasonal end, we like to think of these as transitional pieces that can escort you into spring, allowing you to smartly layer up for one of those “two seasons in a day” weather forecasts without piling on too many knits. Ahead, some of the savviest multi-tasking knits for covering all your bases."

The change in seasons also brings new outfit opportunities. As temperatures rise, we finally get to reach for the tank dresses, sleeveless knits, andsandalswe’ve been aching to wear.\n\nTo help you change over your wardrobe from winter to spring, ELLE editors are sharing thetransitional-weather staplesthey’ll be wearing over the coming weeks. From layering tops tolight jackets, these are thecloset essentialswe rely on as seasons change—and they’re all $200 or less. Looks like fluctuating temperatures and unpredictable weather conditions have finally met their match.\n\n“Layers are my M.O. for transitional dressing,” saysDale Arden Chong, senior fashion commerce editor. “I use a sheer long-sleeve top or turtleneck to give my warm-weather staples a cold-weather appeal in a way that doesn’t compromise my style. And since they come in such a variety of colors, prints, and textures, it’s a great way to mix up your everyday pieces.”\n\n“I love the ease of throwing on a vest with a pair of jeans,” saysAlexis Bennett Parker, commerce content lead. “It’s an instantly chic outfit formula that I live in during the spring. What’s even better? The affordable price points that several trending styles come in.”\n\nWhat’s the point of dressing in layers if you can’t properly shed them? When temperatures begin to rise, reach for a reliable tote bag with enough space to stash a sweater or light jacket when you start to overheat.\n\n“Hear me out: Maxi skirts are great for this time of year,” saysMeg Donohue, associate fashion commerce editor. “On cold days, I can slip into wool tights,heeled boots, and a chunky sweater. When it heats up, I’ll swap in sandals and a short-sleeve bodysuit—or a tank top if I’m feeling really crazy.”\n\nFew feelings compare to the satisfaction of finally being able to wear open-toe shoes again. Save flip-flops and delicate strappy styles for beach weather and welcome the season with these practical spring sandals instead.\n\n“I’m a fan of aone-and-done dress, especially the easy-going silhouettes of a tank dress,” says Bennett Parker. “I love that I can throw these on with a pair offlatsand still look put together.”\n\nThe beauty of a classic crewneck cardigan is that it can be styled as a top or lightweight outer layer. A simple white tee or tank underneath, and voila. You’ve got an outfit that can handle a wide range of weather conditions. Opt for classic spring pastels or add a pop of color with thecherry red hue ELLE staff saw all over NYFW.\n\n“The weeks during late winter and early spring seem primed for a footwear staple like loafers,” says Chong. “Sure, this is a shoe you can wear year-round, but I love loafers most when it’s warm enough to show my ankles. Plus, they look great with or without socks.”\n\n“An oversized blazer is one of my most trusted transitional pieces,” says Donohue. “It’s a light layer that can easily be built upon,andit looks polished, whether I’m wearing jeans and a tee or a slinky dress on a night out.”\n\nSpring 2025’s sleeveless knits give the appearance of a sweater without the added heat under a jacket or blazer. Elevate your casual attire by styling the lightweight, fitted style just as you would a T-shirt.\n\nFew items are as quintessentiallyspringas a trench coat. It’s a wardrobe staple you’ll find in virtually every fashion editor’s closet. For an updated take on the classic, try the boxy, cropped silhouette trending this season.\n\nLike cardigans, button-up shirts work double duty as tops and lightweight outerwear. Whether striped, solid, or ruffle-accented, opt for an oversized fit to make spring layering even more of a breeze."

With that in mind, the Milanese streets are primed for incredible street style to add to your mood boards for the spring season.\n\nThough Fashion Month is always the time to experiment with new trends, there were a few in particular that made regular appearances.

A monochromatic look with this shade will always feel polished—especially because of how close it feels to other neutrals.\n\nNaturally,thatPrada skirt was seen more than once in the streets of Milan, but beyond the out-of-this-world style from the Italian fashion house’s spring/summer 2025 collection, plenty of show attendees throughout the week have been sporting scene-stealing skirts. From gorgeous paillettes to delicate beading and head-turning fringe, these were proof that dressing up a look can often come down to one major piece.\n\nGiven that bombers and blousons are among the biggestspring jacket trendsthis year, it’s no surprise that Milan has seen its fair share of show-goers sporting the lightweight layer to keep them comfortable on the go. Whether they’re styled with an ultra-feminine skirt or a pair of baggy jeans, this easy and effortless staple will give your looks a foolproof cool factor.\n\nThe tried-and-true way to dress up a cold-weather ensemble is—without a doubt—a statement coat. From fluffy faux furs and shearling coats to longer trenches with eye-catching prints (be itanimal, floral, polka dots, or something else), let this bethemoment. Whether you style it with your favorite all-black ensemble or something more elevated like a knit dress or a chic midi skirt, this is the surefire way to ensure your look will garner a double-take.\n\nIf you’ve already hopped on the burgundy tights trend, then the meteoric rise of this color may come as no surprise. In Milan, showgoers embraced the color as the new neutral for spring, whether that be in the form of a monochromatic ensemble or as a single piece like a chic trench coat."

    "title": "Lily Collins Is the New Face of Calvin Klein’s Spring Campaign",

    "content": "Emily in Paris\n\nTove Jane McDowell\n\nCalvin Klein’s Spring 2025 campaign\n\nBermuda shorts\n\neffortless attitude of the ’90s\n\nbold fashion\n\nIt’s a milestone year for Lily Collins. About a month ago, she welcomed her first child, a baby girl namedTove Jane McDowell. Now, she’s making her debut as the face ofCalvin Klein’s Spring 2025 campaign.\n\n“It was a total honor and a dream come true,” Collins exclusively tells ELLE. “I remember cutting out Calvin Klein advertisements from magazines when I was younger and always being drawn to the brand as representing what’s classic and cool.” Now, Collins is the actress-turned-model little girls will see on billboards.\n\nMotherhood has also subtly influenced  Collins’s approach to style. “Comfort has always been important to me, and now more than ever,” she says. When it comes to dressing Tove, she adds, “I can’t wait to see her personal style one day, but for now, I’m having so much fun finding pieces for her.”\n\nIn the campaign images, directed and photographed by Charlotte Wales, Collins exudes confidence—letting a blazer slip off one shoulder, striking a relaxed pose in an unbuttoned vest and coordinatingBermuda shorts.\n\n“I worked with Charlotte before and had the best experience with her,” Collins says. “She has this amazing quality of making you feel so comfortable in your own skin, and I think that energy was incredibly important to feel while shooting this campaign.”\n\nAs expected, the latest collection from the iconic American brand delivers a refined take on wardrobe staples. Think sleek office-to-weekend blazers, fluid silk skirts, and lightweight knits—perfect for transitional-weather dressing. And, of course, it wouldn’t be a Calvin Klein campaign without denim. Collins, in particular, sports a straight-leg pair that channels theeffortless attitude of the ’90s.\n\nAs for her favorite items, Collins shares, “I loved the relaxed plaid wool blazer and tailored A-line mini dress. It made me feel very much like myself. I really love playing with proportions and mixing textures. This felt bold while also being understated.”\n\nSpeaking ofbold fashion, Collins will soon return to the screen as Emily Cooper for the fifth season ofEmily in Paris. “It’s such a pleasure to be part of a global show that highlights new and upcoming designers and provides them a platform to showcase their work,” Collins says. “Fashion is such a big part of our show that it has become a character itself. Our costumes help us tell our stories in ways that words sometimes cannot.”\n\nSimilarly, Calvin Klein’s minimalist approach to spring fashion, combined with Collins’s easy elegance, is the ultimate lesson in looking cool—no flight to Paris required."

As theDopaminesinger hit up a handful of shows during Milan Fashion Week—including Moschino and Blumarine—she made a stop at Ferrari’s presentation in what she describes as an “international spy” aesthetic. And it’s true: Sporting a sleek, sexy ensemble featuring a dark trench coat and matching pants and oversized sunglasses, the singer made espionage look more stylish than ever. In a nod to Ferrari, she sported coordinating leather racing gloves, too.\n\nAside from her fashion month appearances, Normani is said to be working on another album, whichmay or may not land this year.  It would follow last year’s long-awaited debut.\n\n“I know what it’s like to put out music and records that I don’t wholeheartedly believe in,” shetold ELLE last yearahead of the release. “When we were in [Fifth Harmony], we didn’t have the opportunity to have a real opinion until the last project we did. I promised myself, ‘If God gives me another opportunity to do things in my own way, I’m not going to take that for granted.’”\n\nWhile you wait for new music, check out how Normani got ready for Ferrari’s runway show, below."

    "time": "Published: Feb 27, 2025",
    "content": "The White Lotus\n\nThe White Lotus\n\nParty Girl\n\nParty Girl\n\nthat\n\nParty Girl\n\nThe White Lotus\n\nThe White Lotus\n\nThe White Lotus\n\nView full post on Youtube\n\nAll About The White Lotus Season 3 Film Locations\n\nHowThe White LotusIs Changing Travel\n\nThe BestWhite LotusCollabs to Shop Now\n\nLess than a minute after Parker Posey appears on my screen, she’s already showing off a souvenir from her time filmingThe White Lotusin Thailand.\n\n“Look at this scarf from Jim Thompson,” she says, getting up from her chair to hold up the piece. “He’s a designer. He really invigorated the Thai [silk] industry in the ’50s and is rumored to have been a CIA agent. But look…” At this point, the scarf’s palm-tree pattern is covering her whole camera lens. “Isn’t that beautiful?”\n\nPosey is wearing a similar printed kerchief—though this one’s from the Hotel Saint Vincent—around her neck, which complements her round pink sunglasses. It’s not too far from what Victoria Ratliff, the wealthy North Carolina mother of three she plays onThe White Lotus, would wear on her family trip, which seems to be going downhill fast. In fact, she did wear a lot of Jim Thompson on the series.\n\n“Victoria really doesn’t want to leave her room, but she does go to the gift shop and buys a cotton dress and then a pretty scarf, so yeah, this is a total souvenir,” Posey says. “I really love the prints and the textiles in Thailand and Asia. It was so beautiful.”\n\nIn her latest endeavor, starring in Gap’s new spring campaign, the actress sports a bit more of a subdued wardrobe, but her energy is high. She dances like no one is watching in the campaign video, wearing a classic trench coat, carpenter jeans, ribbed shirts, cotton tees, and layered tanks from the brand’s new collection. It’s photographed by Amy Troost, directed by Talia Collis, and choreographed by Sadie Wilking, set to METTE’s song “Mama’s Eyes.”\n\n“I’d seen some videos that they did on YouTube, and it was like, ‘Oh my God, I love this. Please, I can come in, and you can teach me dance steps. I love to dance. This is going to be really fun,’” she says of joining forces with Gap. Once she got to set, “there were all these dancers who could be my children,” she jokes. “So it was like meeting my young self. And I felt like the ’90s were back, and that vibe and that expression, and just being comfortable to dance and and not really look so much at your body but the attitude underneath it. And that just felt really inspiring, and I really enjoyed seeing that strength in the dancers and the fun.”\n\nShe adds, “I wasn’t on TikTok, but I love the dance craze. It was one of the things that made me want to act when I was a little girl, was dancing from the TV and watching the people move and the dancers dance. And so I was excited. I was really touched to be a part of it.” Posey’s campaign follows a string of choreography-filled visuals for Gap, with previous ones starring Tyla and Troye Sivan. “I loved that one. It was so fun to watch,” she said of the latter.\n\n“I think when we’re watching things on our phone, and we’re seeing this choreography, it [propels] people to be strong inside. They project themselves onto the dancers and then carry on with their day with this kind of inner liberation or freedom. So it makes sense that dance has become more popular in fashion.” On that point, she naturally brings up Lady Gaga’s “Abracadabra” video, which dropped just a few weeks before. “You can tell they spent a lot of time on it, and it’s like mini cinema,” she says in awe.\n\nSpeaking of cinema and dance, Posey’s iconic 1995 filmParty Girlturns 30 this year. “What I love aboutParty Girlis just how witty it is, and the jokes, and it just it goes by likethat,” she says with a snap. “It’s not messy, it’s sharp, it’s got style, it’s got color, it’s got humor, it’s got heart.”\n\nLooking back to that time in her life, she reminisces on how “pure and fun” New York felt as a young actor living in the city in a rent-controlled apartment she stayed in for 13 years. “And there were so many free spirits around, right? Gay, lesbian, anybody, everybody, and there was this acceptance. And people really danced in the street.”\n\nShe acknowledges the legacy of theParty Girlcostumes too. “It was a collaborative experience with our wardrobe designer, Michael Clancy, borrowing and coming to my wardrobe closet,” she says. “You were mixing vintage and high fashion at the same time, because you go to thrift shops and you find this designer thing and then something else could be just from the Goodwill.”\n\nThese days though, you’ll see Posey every Sunday night onThe White Lotus—with the likes of Jason Isaacs, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Michelle Monaghan, and more—as season 3 continues to unfold. Filming the show in Thailand for seven months “was a lot, it was rigorous and extreme because it’s really hot at times, but what an experience,” she says. And getting to reunite with her co-stars at the L.A. premiere was “a blast.”\n\n“We went through it all together, and it’s the third pack-a-punch season. I think when you do one and two, the third season is the pinnacle, and people seem to love it, so that was great.”\n\nAfter our call, Posey traveled all the way back to Bangkok for the Thai premiere ofThe White Lotus. I bring up how Victoria struggled to adjust to the time difference, taking a badly-timed nap and then a lorazepam to fall asleep. Posey, however, assures she’ll be just fine with the help of some eye drops and espresso. “I’m a lot better than Victoria at handling jet lag,” she laughs."

Ahead, the designer discusses the first job that brought her into the fashion world, the hero pieces in her own wardrobe, and her best tips for taking a solid mirror selfie.\n\nI worked at Club Monaco all throughout high school in Toronto. Then, when I moved to New York for college, I was taking all these odd jobs. My first was at DNA, the modeling agency. At the time, they still had physical [modeling] books for the girls, so I would organize them. I don’t know if they let people do this anymore, but I would take the girls shopping to help them find their look for their first casting. I would hang out with them at the shows to make sure they had water and they were okay. It was this very formative experience; the idea of Bryant Park and the shows was so insane and amazing. The energy was so inspiring. Even when I was a little girl, one of my friends would come over, and I’d bring out my camcorder, and I’d be like, “You’re Claudia Schiffer. You’re Cindy Crawford. We’re at the Ritz.”\n\nOh God, 25 years ago in New York, I feel like I did every kind of job. I can’t say I had any bad experiences, which is great. They were difficult, and I definitely worked crazy hours; I was working with stylists to prep for fashion shows, and I would be working [for] 24 hours straight for days and barely eating. That was probably the hardest, but it was also so fun. You’re like, “I’m doing it, I’m making it.”\n\nI had been in conversation with J.Crew, and I was like, “Am I going to be able to do this?” The job was beyond exciting. It was my dream. I was also like, “I’m pregnant. It’s a pandemic. This is going to be nuts.” But it’s just a great place to work. It’s an iconic American brand; there are great bones.\n\nMy process is always storytelling. How do you make people feel like this brand is important? How do we make people feel like this deserves to exist, and this is amazing, and it’s relevant? That’s the trigger. I started to pull imagery and create a project to be able to articulate what the future could look like. That’s when it starts to get really exciting, when you start to pull those ideas together. That’s where you start to really feel like the fire of,this can work.\n\nI wanted to help bring the brand back to a place of quality and integrity. We had to re-establish that the quality was beautiful and the garments were made well before we could start to get into fashion and, really, the humor and all these other things. The No. 1 goal was re-establish trust. Then, it was a strange thing—we had a lot of stories to tell, and we couldn’t tell them all, because you only have so many shoots. My mom was like, “I love it when you post pictures of yourself. My friends all love it.” Moms are funny like that. But in the back of my head, I was like, “You know what? I have all these pieces that haven’t really been styled. I’m going to start putting them on.” I started doing that and posting on Instagram, and that built interest from customers. Suddenly, I had this place where people were able to talk to me about what they loved.\n\nThe thing that resonated the most was this love for the nostalgia of the ’80s and the ’90s. Everybody had this story about their first sweater or ordering from the catalog—this emotional tie I had no idea existed. We started to tap into that, and I realized how important the heritage was. It became something we were feeding into that was really working. It’s a moment in the cultural zeitgeist where people are interested in nostalgia. Everything’s so fast and digital, so people are going back to film, to camcorders, they’re looking through old magazines. There’s a romance about that. For the new catalog, the goal was finding a way to tap into that nostalgia but also make it feel modern. You can’t just look back. You have to bring that idea, that feeling, into the future.\n\nArt, for me, is more inspiring than anything else. Sometimes you can exhaust yourself looking at too much fashion, especially as a designer. Art is sort of like going out in nature. It’s calming for me. It makes me feel grounded. Painters work really hard to understand color and proportion and scale and composition in a way that designers do, too. Looking at that, seeing how that works, and how that’s put together is related directly to what I do. Also, culturally, when there are movements in art, it makes me think about fashion—women painting women, women designing for women, the sense of femininity and softness and color. Art’s a reflection of culture, and so is fashion. I’m always putting art up next to images of clothing and product on the concept boards. It’s inspiring just through its sensibility.\n\nIt’s about the person, first and foremost. Of course, it’s about what they do, but you feel this instinct of:This person is great, and they represent culture, and they’re nice and kind and talented.We have to work together for a significant period of time, so it’s about the vibe. Sometimes I’ll reach out through DM. Sometimes people will introduce us, and we’ll have like, a date, a first conversation, and start to feel each other out. It pushes us as a team to work with outside creatives, because it keeps us modern. It keeps us thinking about the future and what other customers like and what other designers can bring to the table.\n\nI have really good natural light in my office, so that helps a lot. Have a good light source, either a selfie light or natural light, that’s coming at you from the side, so it gives you a bit of a glow. If you have natural light, the morning is too harsh; it’s always best in the afternoon and evening, depending on the time of year. Leaning your mirror against the floor and putting it on a slant, versus putting it on the wall, gives you more height and length. Then, always, your body angle—just shifting your body slightly to the side, pushing one leg forward. I learned how to do this myself; it wasn’t something I knew before. There are days where I’m like, “I don’t want to show my face. I’m tired, but I like my outfit.” Then I’ll put the camera in front of my face. Also, what’s interesting is sometimes taking a photo can affirm whether your outfit is good or not. If you’re not sure about what you’re wearing, take a photo of yourself and look at the photo versus looking at yourself in the mirror.\n\nA white shirt, but not by itself necessarily. There’s this thing with the combination of darks and lights: If you have a dark sweater and then you have a white shirt underneath, it just adds a crispness to your look; socks also add that extra element. I always pile up the gold jewelry, because I feel like it really helps with a simple outfit. If the jewelry is the centerpiece, then you need to let the other pieces lay low. I have this amazingJ.Crew chain necklacethat we call the bike lock, because one of the customers wrote in the reviews: “What is this thing? It’s as heavy as a bike lock.” But it’s amazing. You can make it really tight, so it’s like a choker. I wore it the other night with one of ourSpring Street cashmere charcoal gray bodycon dresses, something subtle but chic.\n\nA suit, always. I like things that are looser and more relaxed. I’ll wear a belt, a low tank top or a T-shirt, and I’ll put on a bunch of jewelry. [I] just try to make it feel a little more chill and fashion-forward in the way that I like. If it’s not a suit, it’s jeans and a blazer. Sometimes, for a party or a meeting, I’ll put on a heel to feel taller and more commanding. But also a great loafer or a flat can actually ground you and make you feel confident, because you can move around quickly and easily.\n\n“A beautiful top coat is a great way to finish off a look. If it’s your very first one, and you need it to work hard for you, I’d get camel, charcoal gray, black, navy, or even red. I also always end up wearing a cream coat a lot in the winter.”\n\n“Cashmere is always important to this brand. We’re building this repertoire of great styles. We started with the classic crew, and then we added the shrunken crew.”\n\n“I’m wearing the jean that Demi Moore wore on our catalog cover. I love this jean, because I think we did a really good job of making it look vintage. It feels like something you’ve owned forever.”\n\n“We always have really pretty jewelry. All those big gold bangles and amazing earrings, like lightweight, statement, sculptural-looking earrings.”\n\n“All the cashmere, we’ve done it in hats and scarves and gloves.”\n\n“The last few years, I’m like, ‘Everything has to have a belt.’ We have skinny belts, wide ones, crocodile belts.”\n\n“I wear the featherweight cardigan andthe shelloften. I love a twin set, and I think they’re back. I wear it with oversized jeans and a big belt.”\n\n“You have to wear [a twin set] with something chill on the bottom, or you wear it with a little skirt and a pair of Mary Janes, so you feel more schoolgirl.”\n\n“We have the brushed cashmere, which is this new invention. I’ve always loved fuzzy sweaters, but they’re either not great for the environment, or they’re really itchy. It took us three years to develop this quality. It’s really, really soft and has that beautiful, luscious vibe to it.”\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity."

    "time": "Published: Aug 20, 2024",
    "content": "my\n\nAllbirds\n\nWool Runners\n\nTree Gliders\n\n$135 at Allbirds\n\nWomen's Health US\n\nWhile cheering on my brother-in-law as he ran his first marathon in Boston in 2019, my feet started to ache. I spotted anAllbirdsnearby, and though the brand was relatively new in the U.S., theWool Runnerswere rumored to feel like slipping into a pair of cozy socks. I wasn’t the one running the race, but after hours standing in the chilly New England air, evenmytoes needed relief. So, between our designated water handoff points, I ducked into a store—and my love affair with Allbirds began.\n\nAs I eased into my first pair, I could already tell the shoes would live up to the hype: Soft, supportive soles relieved my aching arches, and the breathable wool upper kept my toes warm in the cool weather (and it didn’t hurt that I could scoop them up in a delightful buttery yellow). My new sneakers got me through the rest of that long, exciting day, and I’ve been bopping around in those Wool Runners ever since. But they’re clocking in at more than five years old now, so when the opportunity presented itself to review the brand’s latest release, I had to give them a try.\n\nEnter theTree Gliders. Upon opening the box, I was excited by the sleek silhouette. The crisp white soles, creamy woven beige uppers (seamless, with no tongue), and chocolaty brown trim details stood out most—that is, until I picked the sneakers up. At only half a pound each, they are ultra-lightweight—I popped them onto my food scale out of pure curiosity. I was eager to test them out, so I embarked on a comparison of my trusty OG Wool Runners with the new Tree Gliders over the course of a week.\n\nI live in Connecticut and work in New York City, which means I face a healthy commute at least three days a week. After my first trip in the Tree Gliders, I was hooked. If you thought Wool Runners were comfortable, get ready to be impressed. Allbirds created this shoe with athleisure in mind, and let me just say: These sneakers are leggings for your feet. The bouncy SuperLight midsole (thicker and springier than the Wool Runner’s SweetFoam) gives my foot a solid foundation, and the stretchy yet supportive uppers bring tons of all-day comfort.\n\nMy morning commute is often rushed—I have to book it a mile and a half from Grand Central to my office across town in Columbus Circle—so rather than walk, I take the subway. My new sneakers had me dashing through the Times Square station with conviction day after day, ducking between tourists and buskers to catch my connections, the sloped toe propelling me forward all the while. In the evenings, though, weather permitting, I prefer to walk. And my Tree Gliders came through there as well, getting me back to the train station in comfort and style every night, no blisters or cramps. I even got a few compliments along the way.\n\nMy biggest qualm about my Wool Runners is simply that they’re made with, well, wool. While the material is breathable and naturally odor-resistant, they’re also naturally toasty, and I much prefer to wear them for casual outings and in cooler climates. If I’m likely to break a sweat, I leave them at home.\n\nThe Tree Gliders, on the other hand, feature a lightweight, breathable, woven-tree-fiber upper that is as airy as it is good-looking, and the lack of a tongue means no adjusting my shoes mid-workout. I have my fair share of clumsy moments, but the wide, sturdy sole makes me feel grounded and stable while I exercise. Even on a rainy day, the tread had me striding confidently through the slippery streets of New York. Oh, and the sleek silhouette transitioned easily from Pilates studio to gym to train to work. I never felt the need to slip into a more appropriate shoe.\n\nOne of my favorite things about my Wool Runners is how comfortable they are: I can slide them on and dash out of the house for a gallon of milk and still feel as if I’m snug as a bug in my house slippers. That’s in part because of how long I’ve had them (the soles have molded to my feet like orthotics) and in part because that’s just how well they were designed.\n\nI wasn’t sure the Tree Gliders would be able to match that coziness level, but it turns out they blend comfort and aesthetics for a shoe that cradles my feet everywhere, from the pharmacy to a coffee date. I particularly love that they feature that no-tongue silhouette, making them even easier to slip on than my Wool Runners are. And I didn’t even need time to break them in; my feet were blister-free after the first use.\n\nAll in all, the Allbirds Tree Gliders are an exciting new option: lightweight, breathable, comfortable, and supportive, all while sporting an on-trend aesthetic. I’m looking forward to running them into the ground—pun very much intended."

    "content": "thing.\n\nlooking\n\ncontinually share\n\nby acting as personal stylists\n\nGift of Gabs\n\nA Tiny Apt.\n\nGumshoe\n\nDorsey\n\nWhat I Put On Today\n\nwriter and brand strategist Erika Veruink\n\nLong Live.\n\nTime Less\n\nAnother Fashion Newsletter\n\nThe Love List\n\npaywall their entire chats\n\nThe way we shop secondhand has drastically changed over the years. Once upon a time, you had to pop into your favorite thrift store and rifle through racks of tossed-away garments to cherry-pick the good stuff. Fast forward to the late ’90s and early 2000s, and eBay paved the way for peer-to-peer platforms like Depop and Poshmark—as well as luxury consignment sites such as The RealReal. And over the pandemic, there was a big uptick in buying and selling directly on Instagram, which birthed a new wave of trust-based resale.\n\nBut it’s more than just a flash in the pan—the tide change indicates an authentic shift in consumer behavior, as we see individuals prioritizing used clothing as a way to do better for the environment and their wallets. Resale reportscontinually sharethat not only are people turning to secondhand first, but even items that are “well-loved” are being snapped up, indicating that condition doesn’t play as big of a factor anymore either. And now, it seems there’s a surprising new option for secondhand shopping: Substack.\n\nThe online platform’s popularity within the fashion space isn’t new. After all, we’ve seen former editors build devoted followingsby acting as personal stylists—readers chime in on everything from vacation recommendations to what to wear for an upcoming wedding. But the buying and selling that’s happening here? It’s athing.\n\n“When I opened up Chat [where writers and creators have conversations with their subscribers], I had no idea it would become a space for buying and selling,” shares Gabriella Gofis ofGift of Gabs, whose threads are extremely active with resale listings. “One of the best success stories I’ve heard is one subscriber selling a Row Margaux bag to another subscriber,” she says. “I received a very kind message thanking me for the chat, because it led her to her dream purchase.”\n\nChristene Barberich, author ofA Tiny Apt., echoes this interaction. “Pretty soon after I started A Tiny Apt., I began hosting ‘flash’ micro tag sales every few months, as well as vintage giveaways for paid subscribers where the first person to drop a comment gets it,” she shares. “I think a lot of people show up to score something great, but some just like to see what I have and what others are saying about these beautiful, rare, occasionally weird collectible things. It really has the potential to be a true social marketplace.”\n\nIn a way, this turn of consumer events makes perfect sense: people have a direct line to an audience they know are avid shoppers, always on the hunt. Even if readers aren’t necessarilylookingfor the items being hawked, like many online purchases, impulse plays a big role. All of this coupled with the notion that these spaces are seen as Substack author-approved, you have a platform that’s ripe for buying and selling. “I think people have become more acclimated to trust-based interactions,” shares Harling Ross, the brains behindGumshoe, a shopping newsletter with an emphasis on secondhand and one-of-a-kind items. “I haven’t introduced a Chat, yet but it’s something I do see myself doing in an intentional way.”\n\n“Selling these Prada leather T-strap sandals, size 7.5. They’re beautiful but too big—$60,” writes one user in Gift of Gabs’ Chat. In which a fellow subscriber quickly responds “Me!” “Selling a pair of Jamie Haller black loafers, worn once,” writes another user. Interactions like this are a constant in many of these forums—with dozens of new “listings”' a day, nestled between the sizing questions and the brand suggestions.\n\n“I’ve always been a proponent of shopping secondhand,” shares Meg Strachan, founder and CEO ofDorseyand the publisher ofWhat I Put On Today. “I think my community has affinities for a lot of the same brands and the discussions evolved organically—from readers posting here and there to now actually selling items. It’s really taken off in the past six months.”\n\n“There is something about shopping in Substack that feels like being at a New York City sample sale,” addswriter and brand strategist Erika Veruink, who’s the author of the secondhand shopping-focused SubstackLong Live.“Everyone’s chatting and there’s a community that wouldn’t make sense in any other context,” she says. And while not everyone has taken the plunge, they are indeed taking notice.“I haven’t made a resale purchase through the platform yet, but I’m always excited to see what surfaces whenever I check in,” shares Joyce Lee ofTime Less.\n\nWhile many find this burgeoning market appealing, for some authors and buyers alike, the lack of regulation is where it gets a bit dicey. “There is something about the nascence of it that feels so pure—which I love—but I do see a lot of chatter about how it’s not the place for reselling,” shares Sogole Kane, communications executive and writer ofAnother Fashion Newsletter.\n\n“I bought an Aesther Ekme bag off Substack not too long ago and I was so excited about it, but sadly the seller went back on it,” Kane shares. “She direct messaged me and said that someone else offered more, so she sent my money back.” The lack of oversight is a sore point for some authors, as well. “The buy-sell aspect was an interesting use of our Chat community, but it quickly got annoying,” shares Jess Graves of the popular SubstackThe Love List. “People would complain that sellers spam multiple channels with the same listings, and that the high volume made it hard to find the meaningful content.” Currently, it falls upon the author to regulate, which depending on preference is either welcomed or fully not.\n\n“I had to step in and moderate the channel, establishing some rules,” Graves shares. “The most important being to only post items on the monthly resale thread, which organizes sale items into one easy-to-find space and keeps a clean house on our channel without eliminating sellers completely.” Strachan has a similar philosophy. “The flaw is that Substack isn’t currently built for transactions like this, and it can often become overwhelming. I’ve started jumping in to moderate.”\n\nDespite the infancy of Substack—particularly in regard to resale—many do see it as a new frontier for secondhand, including Substack itself. “People selling items via the chat feature has been fascinating to see,” shares Christina Loff, Substack’s head of lifestyle partnerships.\n\n“Substack is built on direct relationships and trust between publishers and their audiences. Publishers set the rules and curate the experience. Based on feedback, we recently introduced the ability for publishers topaywall their entire chats, making it available only to their most committed audience, paid subscribers,” she says. “Ultimately, our goal is to serve publishers’ needs and give them features to help grow and serve their communities.”\n\nRegardless of how resale on Substack continues to evolve, there’s one thing that most can agree on—and that’s the shared love for the platform. As Gafis puts it: “I really love that it is bringing people together in this way—it’s a true community, which is all I could have ever hoped for.”"

    "title": "The Feminist Roots of the Chinese Qipao",
    "time": "Published: May 9, 2024",
    "content": "AsHeather Guostrolls down the streets of Manhattan in her burgundy qipao, passersby turn their heads to catch a glimpse, as if she was a character from a Wong Kar-wai film. Meticulously hand-stitched with threads of gold and silver, her long silk qipao, a traditional Chinese dress dating back to the Qing Dynasty (1644–1912), is adorned with delicate floral patterns that seem to whisper stories from a bygone era. Wearing the dress today, she weaves together the contemporary charm of New York City with the timeless allure of 1950s Shanghai.\n\nGuo, who was born in Shanghai and moved to the U.S. when she was 15 years old, is an avid qipao collector. She boasts over 300 qipaos from around the world, dating back to the 1950s and ’60s, and recently opened her shop, Xiangjiang Vintage—which specializes in carrying the traditional dress—in New York City’s West Village, attracting Asian American customers with her vast catalog of styles.\n\nThe qipao, also known as the cheongsam in Cantonese, is often made with embroidered silk, and features high collars and straight lines. The dress has had many iterations over the centuries, and heavily influenced the world’s perception of Asian women.\n\nIn the 1920s, as women broke free from Confucian social norms, the tailors producing the dresses embraced the Western flapper styles, which were characterized by short hemlines and afitted bodice. Antonia Finnane, a history professor at the University of Melbourne and author ofHow to Make a Mao Suit: Clothing the People of Communist China, 1949–1976, told ELLE.com that “the qipao evolved from a square-cut, looser-fitting style—initially related to Manchu dress—to the sheath style in the 1930s. This transformation reflected the changing perception of women’s bodies as they gained more freedom and were no longer confined to traditional roles. They no longer had to hide themselves in the voluminous garments that their mothers and grandmothers wore.”\n\nThe silhouette changed over time, but the meaning behind the qipao remained constant: women’s liberation and the evolvement of self-perception. In the 1940s, the adoption of bras in Hong Kong and Taiwan further transformed the dress, with dressmakers using darts to shape the bodice and emphasize the bust, according to Finnane. From 1949 until the 1970s, the qipao lost popularity, as many perceived it as a relic of outdated Chinese traditions at odds with the drive for modernization. People gravitated towards more functional, Western-inspired attire like jackets and trousers. Amid the upheaval of the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s, however, numerous tailors sought refuge in Hong Kong, where they blended traditional Chinese aesthetics with Western influences, and so the dress flourished in the then-British colony.\n\nThe qipao made another return to the fashion world in the ’90s and early 2000s whenfast fashion brandscapitalized on traditional Chinese prints and silhouettes. Brands like Forever 21 produced so-called“mandarin-collared”shirts with machine-stitched dragons and Chinese characters that don’t form actual phrases. In 2002,Abercrombie & Fitch faced criticismfor selling T-shirts with racial slurs and images, such as “Wong Brothers Laundry Service—Two Wongs Can Make It White.”\n\nAlthough the qipao has historically been associated with the women’s liberation movement, reflecting evolving perceptions of women’s bodies as they broke free from traditional roles, some brands disregarded its rich history and the struggles of oppression endured by Chinese women. These companies often commercialized and fetishized traditional attire, disregarding its deeper meaning.In 2019,PrettyLittleThing’s collaboration with British girl group Little Mixreceived backlash from the API+ community for culturally appropriating traditional Chinese attire. The collection, which featured crop tops and mini skirts in dragon patterns, was described as “oriental” by the brand.\n\nRuohan Song, a traditional Chinese fashion influencer and qipao collector, tells ELLE.com that Chinese women in the U.S. still face stereotypes and sexualization because of the way those who wear qipaos have been portrayed in the media. Asian female characters who wear them are either seen as intimidating (like the “Dragon Lady,” inspired by the female villain from the comicTerry and the Pirates), as delicate and submissive, or as hypersexualized, reinforcing narrow and outdated stereotypes. “When we [consider] the qipao in the U.S., people often think of a dress with a high slit that reveals thighs and buttocks with a cut-out in the front, which is drastically different from the traditional dress,” Song says. “When you search on Amazon, the descriptions and pictures are horrifying. I feel disheartened that only a handful of people knew the history behind this dress.”\n\nIn 2017, a heated debate broke out on social media over a non-Chinese high school studentwho posted pictures of herself wearing a red qipaoto prom. The question ofwhether someone who is not Chinese could wear the traditional dress went viral, but Song feels it is more complex than that. “It’s important to understand that the perception of the qipao is deeply ingrained in society, and it’s not the fault of those who wear them,” she says. “Fetishization and appropriation are not desirable, but if, for example, I had an American friend who had studied the history behind the dress and wanted to wear one with respect and understanding, I would find that completely acceptable. It’s important to approach this with respect and an informed attitude.”\n\nGuo agrees that educating people about the garment’s historical and cultural significance is crucial to preventing cultural appropriation and misrepresentation. “Like the kimono in Japan, the qipao has also been used as a tool to sexualize and objectify women, perpetuating stereotypes. The misinterpretation diminishes the achievements of Asian women and makes them more vulnerable,” she says.\n\nTo encourage more women to appreciate the beauty of the traditional qipao, she works with a tailor in Shanghai to create new designs inspired by vintage styles to sell. Currently, her Manhattan shop has over 30 designs, each available in seven sizes. “It’s not true that only slim women can wear qipao. Almost everyone can find their perfect dress here,” says Guo.\n\nFor Guo, the qipao represents more than just a fashion statement. She sees it as a bridge to the past, connecting her to the women who wore these dresses to make a statement. “I could feel their liberation as women, their struggles to challenge societal norms, and their appreciation for their bodies and identities,” Guo says. She believes Hong Kong’s fashion history deserves more recognition, which is why she named her store “Xiangjiang Vintage” after the Mandarin term for the city.\n\nMany fashion brands, both in China and the U.S., are now embracing “modern Chinese style” by incorporating qipao-inspired buttons and high collars, but Guo believes it’s essential to stick to traditional designs when crafting qipaos. Traditional qipao options in the U.S. are very limited, making it a challenge to change the public’s perception of the dress, which is why she is committed to preserving her culture.\n\nAs Guo walks to a coffee shop in her qipao,  I—a Chinese woman living in the U.S.—have to wonder if she has ever felt scared of being “unapologetically Chinese” on the street, considering the uptick in hate crimes over the last few years. “I feel liberated in qipao,” Guo  says. “By wearing it daily, I want to encourage more Chinese women to find their identities and sense of belonging through the dress. If I can proudly wear the dress, then we could move beyond the anti-Chinese racism and find who we really are.”"

    "content": "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\n\nun-dressing\n\nI’m going to go through with this divorce\n\nfeeling\n\nRunaway Bride.\n\nPrincess Diana and her little black dress\n\nShould I Stop Wearing My Ex’s Clothes?\n\nLet’s Break Down These Celeb Breakup Notes\n\nI didn’t get married anticipating divorce. Nor did I, a fashion and beauty editor, expect to find all my garments suddenly unwearable. Yet there I was, alone in my bedroom, with a wardrobe full of nothing I wanted to wear.\n\nI wish I could tell you there was a big, explosive blowout, a tantalizing scandal, or a major red flag that festered or metastasized beyond the point of reconciliation, but the sad truth is that we grew apart. And as the chasm between us became too wide to bridge, it felt easier to separate gracefully than to force a lifetime together.\n\nAfter a breakup, most people wax melancholic about the landmarks they frequented, once-cherished memories that become almost too painful, too unbearable to hold onto— anecdotal souvenirs that they wish they could scrub clean,Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind-style. Remember how happy we were there and there and there? For me, those tales are told in threads: There’s the Only NY long-sleeve I bought, because it was one of his favorite brands; a J.Crew sweater he gifted me during one of our first holidays together; the vintage Thierry Mugler suit I snagged on one of our trips to San Francisco; the navy ruched dress I wore to his friend’s wedding; and then, of course, there was our own wedding—the Calvin Klein Collection dress I got custom-made for the big day. My closet felt like a gravesite, memorializing all these moments we had together, large and small.\n\nWe were together 11 years—pretty much all of my 20s and the entirety of my time in New York. When so much of yourself is tethered to one person, when both of your lives become entirely enmeshed, it goes without saying that it’s exceedingly difficult to extricate yourself when it’s over. We decided to separate in 2022 and officially filed for divorce a year later. Sartorially, I coped by not wanting to wear anything I owned—or anything at all. “I just want to be naked!” I declared to anyone who asked how I was doing. One point, last summer, I said this while wearing a translucent, mini slip dress with nothing underneath except a teeny-tiny bralette and an equally teeny-tiny pair of hot pants.\n\n“Well, it looks like you’re nearly there,” quipped a friend, her eyebrows raised.\n\nThe psychology behind post-breakup fashion is intuitive to grasp: A change in appearance, whether it be a haircut or your entire sartorial outlook, is a way to demarcate the end of one chapter and the start of another. You get a clean slate without having to wait to ring in a new year.\n\nThe most popular term that gets thrown around in reference to this is “revenge dressing.” (See:Princess Diana and her little black dress.) But I don’t believe that revenge dressing—or in my case, revengeun-dressing—applies here. “People get divorced for different reasons,” says Susan Weiss, LCSW (and, full disclosure, my therapist). “Princess Diana was rejected for another woman, and she was demeaned in every way, so she was making a statement: ‘I’m getting back, I’m showing all of you.’” Weiss continues, “Everybody’s marriage is different. I think the way you dressed paralleled the mood in your marriage. And when you decided,I’m going to go through with this divorce, I think you were liberated.”\n\nI want to make it absolutely clear: I wasn’t in an unhappy marriage, or a bad one for that matter. But in many ways I felt stuck and unseen. It’s hard to discern why I chose to dress the way I did—how does anyone? Pinpointing the reason can be as elusive as attempting to define a nebulous concept like love. The intricate makings of personal style are akin to hand-stitching fine lacework. Fleeting and abstract, so much of piecing together an outfit is based on afeeling. So for me to say I dressed all in black because I was in a sad marriage is reductive, and also wrong.\n\nBut I can say that I largely gravitated toward a restrained color palette. In my 20s, during a time when I was trying to prove myself as a writer and editor in a notoriously unkind, unforgiving industry, I wanted people to take me seriously, so I wore somber colors and modest styles—so modest, they bordered on puritanical. There was a period where hemlines hardly ever hiked higher than my shin. And those ankle-grazing skirts were often paired with baggy sweaters, oversized button-downs, or turtlenecks. My approach to fashion was austere, all clean lines and rigid, stark, minimalist silhouettes; I thought those were the trappings of Good Style. And anything outside of it (color, embellishments, skin-exposing cutouts) I considered frivolous and, quite frankly, gauche, and thus Bad. In retrospect, I imagine that a part of me wanted to hide behind my clothing.\n\nAnd that inadvertently bled into how I dressed outside of work—or perhaps, it worked in tandem. My ex and I were both so focused on our careers that in our downtime together, we did nothing. I’m not entirely sure when things between us got to be so serious, but it reached a point where every moment, every activity, every conversation felt laden with an inexplicable weight. Spending time together was like wading through molasses, impossibly tough and tiresome. How I so badly wished there was lightness or laughter or joy, but what was missing was too blatant to ignore, despite how much I cared about him. And so, there was no desire to dress up. I hardly wore makeup. My nails were rarely painted. Apathy masqueraded as comfort. I combed through my closet recently and tried on a dress I wore B.D. (Before Divorce). I was aghast at how shapeless it was, how much fabric there was, how blah and invisible I felt in it.\n\nRipping our lives apart was a gut-wrenching process. Heartbreaking. A big part of why I held onto my marriage was because I had an all-consuming fear of starting over, which isn’t a good reason to stay in any relationship. But now, as a no-longer-married person—for the first time in over a decade—I’ve embarked on the long, unrelenting road of figuring out who I am, like Julia Roberts determining how she likes her eggs inRunaway Bride.\n\n“Although the word divorce is often viewed as sad in one’s life, it can also be freeing. In a dysfunctional marriage, we can lose our sense of self and our own identity. And we may become very stifled in our creativity and growth,” Weiss says. “So post-divorce can offer an opportunity to explore different sides of ourselves. And fashion is the perfect outlet to show those changes.”\n\nWhile I might want to parade around naked, the law—and common decency—forbids it. Instead, I’ve made some purchases: a vintage, cowl-neck metallic mini reminiscent of 2002 Paris Hilton, a collection of truncated tanks, a strappy bandeau, a curve-hugging mesh dress with up-to-there slits, and a two-piece sequin set. A friend called my new look “very Gen Z.” So many others have expressed their surprise. “That doesn’t seem like your style at all” has been the common refrain. Another said it looked like I was going through a midlife crisis, that maybe I should dress my age.\n\nA part of me feels like I’m flailing, like I’m unsure of my footing and stumbling around like a toddler learning how to walk; another part exudes a level of confidence I haven’t felt in so long, maybe ever. For the first time, I’m experimenting with my style, no-holds-barred, and dressing in a way that makes me feel desirable, even pretty. There’s also the possibility that all of this coincides with just growing older and finally feeling comfortable in my skin.\n\nFor now, I’ll hold onto what delights me: itty-bitty midriff-exposing tops, micro hemlines, and see-through everything. Finally, these clothes have started to make my closet feel like mine again."

We asked Waxman to draw inspiration from these bottles to style four party looks, each expertly matched to its respective bottle’s fashion-forward aesthetic.\n\nWaxman’s process is guided by a sharp instinct, and backed by research: In preparation for this shoot, she pored over archive collections, as well as a book on a renowned Japanese designer’s larger-than-life apparel. “I love being transported into a world that someone’s created through their mind—I think that’s the goal of working with images,” Waxman muses. “You go on a journey, tell a story, or create a character. Every element matters, in that sense.”\n\nThen, instead of sourcing a fanciful lineup of potential wardrobe options, Waxman pulled only the pieces she planned to use, focusing on previously loved items.

    "title": "Should I Stop Wearing My Ex’s Clothes?",
    "time": "Published: Apr 11, 2024",
    "content": "I tore through my apartment like a junkie, craving my ex’s scent. I couldn’t say exactly what that scent was, only that he—we’ll call him X—had one when he was mine. After five years together, X and I had parted just some months earlier. The possibility of a lingering cologne didn’t feel unrealistic. I came upon a sleeve pressed behind layers of outerwear on the coat rack, and there it was: X’s single-breasted wool overcoat. I brought its lining to my nose; the silk was cold, and its fibers scentless, so I tried it on. Big and boxy, it felt more powerful than my petite, drop-shoulder version. I turned this way and that in front of the mirror, hands in his empty pockets. I styled it with heeled boots and sneakers; with a shoulder purse and without; with the collar down and up, revealing a dapper cobalt underside—this coat was staggeringly versatile!\n\nI’ve been wearing X’s coat almost every day since, pathologically reaching for it when I go to work events, media dinners, and industry parties. I haven’t seen him since he moved out eight months ago, but I still live in the home we built together—between the walls and the cabinets he painted, the furniture he assembled, the photos he took, the dimmer switches he installed, amidst his shoes, his books, and his mail. I live with a ghost.\n\nI’m seeing someone new now.We were going down the elevator one day after hehad slid on a roomy sweatshirt of mine. I casually gave the backstory of its gargantuan size—it belonged to a hulking rugby player I used to kiss in college. He went back upstairs and changed. Did he overreact? Or was I the pathological one—some creepy Talented Mr. Ripley cycling through the skins of people, unbothered by the souls they once contained? I decided to take a poll and speak with other women about reclaiming their ex’s clothes—other writers and creatives in media and fashion who, perhaps, had their own stories to tell.\n\nNina Renata Aron, the author ofGood Morning, Destroyer of Men’s Souls: A Memoir of Women, Addiction, and Love, keeps two garments from her ex: A Necros (’80s hardcore punk band) T-shirt and a sweatshirt that says “You are dead” on the front and “Los Angeles Straight Edge” on the back. They’re from a boyfriend with whom, she deadpans to me, “I had such a tempestuous relationship, I had to write a whole book about it.” She used to crave his scent, too. “I’d keep his hair pomade and just huff it all the time. It wasn’t even his. I went out and bought the brand he used.” Her current partner helped her destroy the pomade, along with the rest of his stuff (save the shirt and sweatshirt). Her ex was an addict, and she’d felt she owed it to him to watch over his possessions until he got better. Years passed. He was never coming to retrieve anything. “My new boyfriend, a few times, gently suggested, ‘If you’re ready to get rid of this stuff, I’ll help you,’ and finally we did.”\n\nIt brings me back to a conversation I had with the new guy I’m seeing. Late one night, I told him, flat-eyed, that I was living in a haunted house. He thudded on my door a few days later, arms straining full of potted plants and a vibrant bouquet of flowers. “I’m bringing in new life,” he said.\n\nWhen talking with Aron, another interesting theme surfaced: co-opting cred. “The clothes are such markers of authenticity to anybody who knows about punk’s history, so wearing them feels like borrowing some of the authority that this ex had, the swagger.” It parallels screenwriter Chaconne Martin-Berkowicz’s black cashmere sweater, taken from her first serious boyfriend. “It represented a certain sophistication that I was adopting. Zeke had better taste in clothing than I did. I admired that about him.” The sweater symbolized the beginning of her aesthetic cultivation. “I always trusted Zeke when I was putting together an outfit. I learned to ascertain what looks good and what doesn’t for my body through him.”\n\nWhile Martin-Berkowicz’s ex shared his tastes and world with her, Aron’s kept her out. For her, there’s satisfaction in claiming something from a group that excluded her. “I always felt kept out of those punk circles. He wielded his power among those people, and so I think I was already determined to change the meaning and make it mine. I was like, ‘This doesn’t belong to those assholes. This belongs to me now.’”\n\nX never gatekept a world from me. What I wanted to leech from him were traits that felt gifted by God. He was good at everything, hyper-capable and deft in a manner that felt superhuman. Cool and unflappable, he had a quiet stillness exemplified by the sound of his voice. Like pours of warm honey, it never went above a whisper. I once took him to the party of a mega-famous actor, and as cameras flashed around us, the celebrity lavished him with compliments on his looks—the health of his hair and the quality of his skin. “Should we take a selfie together?” the actor asked, between adulations. It was a display of whimsy more than anything, yet something that would have gotten me mildly flustered had I been the object of such attention. X looked like he’d just woken from a nap.\n\nWhile I’m small and half-Asian, X is 6’2” and Scandinavian. I think his stature, his whiteness, and his sheer maleness made me feel more legitimized entering certain spaces. He traveled with me as I reported on a story across Lake Como. Hotel staff would heartily greet him with my last name: “Mr. Mancini! Welcome!” They assumed him to be the journalist coming to visit. And why not? His very build—broad-shouldered and lean, with this unerringly straight tread—radiated authority and elegance. When it came to his athleticism (skilled in everything from riding motorcycles to snowboarding), the sky was the limit. Well, not even. A skydiver, he most recently got his pilot’s license. Then there was the herculean control. We were carrying furniture once, and the corner of this monolithic wardrobe slipped and fell squarely on his toe. Flushing red with pain, X didn’t make a sound; rather, he lifted it back up. “Keep going,” he breathed, bleeding. I was horrified. I was awed.\n\nOur biggest difference: X was never scared, not of the world nor of his own mind. At any given moment, I was thinking about the perils of dying, accidentally stabbing myself in the eye with a knife while chopping, tripping on a curb and knocking my teeth out, or how horrible it would be to get raped. At any given moment, X seemed to be thinking of concepts that structure podcasts—things like innovation, the future of AI, or fusion energy. X embodied everything I lacked, and everything I longed for.\n\n“These relationships do reveal to us our own deeply-held beliefs, about who we are and the supremacy of certain qualities,” Aron reflects. The idea has made me question the dichotomy I’ve created between X and me: his superiority, my inferiority. I recognize an internalized sexism and an internalized racism. And yet, I wear his coat and fantasize about the transference that could occur, if transference were real. What if I, too, could be scared of nothing? An invulnerable machine? I’m not talking about aligning myself with cool styles or groups. I’m talking about his human makeup. What if we could leech the lifeblood we most desired, like vampires?\n\nThis idea of subsuming arises in how some women style their ex’s clothes—a signifying of male provenance, yet encased within ultra-femme juxtapositions. “I used to wear it on top of this sparkly mini dress with tights and booties,” says Martin-Berkowicz of her big black sweater. Model and DJ Gilly Chan would pair her ex’s oversized, plaid vintage blazer, from a jazz musician 10 years her senior, with “a tight top or a fancy dress.” Aron only wears her large sweatshirt with a long floral number. “He had many articles of clothing that probably would’ve fit me better. But these things are almost like wearing the fur of an animal you killed,” she says of donning these hard-won trophies—the plunders of a war you survived.  It feels just a touch more fanged than borrowing masculinity. It’s eating it and regurgitating a remixed version.\n\nChan was “20 or 21” when she dated the older musician. “In retrospect, he was probably running away from a lot of internal demons, and being with someone younger was a distraction for him.” When she recalls his plaid blazer, the smell of cigarettes and the taste of martinis come to mind. She kept it “as a memento from this version of myself that no longer exists.” Another woman, who wishes to remain anonymous, also uses her ex’s clothing as a proof point. Her ex-husband’s T-shirts serve as evidence that the eight-year marriage was real. “I was dumped and cheated on. When a bad relationship happens, you protect yourself by not remembering.” The T-shirts serve as evidence she did not simply delete eight years of her life.\n\nWhile she possesses nothing from her most formative relationship with a man named Paul, independent creative director Joelle McKenna says, “If I had something of his, I would keep it like a family heirloom. I wouldn’t touch it because I would want to be buried with it.” Wryly smirking at her own melodrama, her sentiment is nonetheless earnest. What she does keep are her “gifts ungiven”: a stamp with a whistle on it (her nickname for him was “P Whistle”), an 1800s copy ofPoor Richard’s Almanack, phrases, writing, movies—all items accumulated toward the end of the relationship that she then lost her chance to give. He’s married now, and she wants him to be happy and free. Despite inheriting no material things, she treasures her intangibles. “My sense of humor, trust in the good of humanity, and feeling like there’s magic in the world was informed by that relationship. Paul was a minimalist. He had nothing, and gave me everything.”\n\nThe thing about killing someone you love is that, in death, they become saints. We idealize them. “It’s easier to miss someone than love someone,” journalist Eliza Dumais says to me over dinner. With that in mind, and recalling McKenna’s description of Paul, I hear myself describing X—more myth than man. I recall how I once spoke of X to the new guy I’m seeing. “He was Superman,” I said, instantly regretting my word choice.\n\nMichelle Ochs, the creative director of Hervé Léger, is markedly joyful about her ex’s collared shirts—a time machine back to the electric start of her career in New York. “It reminds me of optimism,” she describes. “The world was open. He was starting in his career as a finance guy. I was starting in mine. I remember the energy of the city, getting ready together in the morning, leaving together.” I ask if she still thinks of the shirts as his. Without a beat, she laughs, “They’re mine! It’s become part of my narrative. It’s my story that he was in.” While almost every woman outlines the importance of breathing room with their ex’s things, Ochs sums it up best: “You need the time. You need the space in between to become who you are, to reflect back.”\n\nSitting with this, I admit I started wearing my ex’s coat too soon. Because I’ve had no interaction with him as a man who’s no longer mine, it’s as if he’s just been on a very long business trip. Perhaps it’s why I haven’t gotten rid of his other stuff. In this other life, he’s still coming home. But people are never frozen where you left them. They move on. The starkest reminder of this is the appearance of a beautiful girl on his otherwise quiet Instagram stories.\n\nSloane Crosley, who most recently authored the memoirGrief Is for People, makes me chuckle at how un-tortured she is on the topic of her ex’s clothes: “I’m not that weepy about the item!” The item in question is a long-sleeve baseball T-shirt from a guy who worked for The Criterion Collection. “Their softball team was called ‘The True Foes,’” she shares. The graphic: “A sketch of an angry anthropomorphized ball.” She has zero memory of its provenance, “no recollection of stealing it or of it being given to me. It’s just here.” She lightheartedly questions its ownership: “Is it ‘mine’? Or has it just been unwittingly on loan for a decade or two? Who can say?” She’s still friends with the ex in question.\n\nA few weeks later, I sit beside chef Camille Becerra at another dinner. We discuss the point of memoir, the act of returning to things we’re not meant to return to. “At the very least,” she muses, glowing in the candlelight, “it’ll help somebody else.” Several of my closest friends ended their relationships this year, a few more recently than I did. I’d love to say time heals all, and happiness erases sadness, but I’ve come to find the happier I feel in my new relationship, the deeper my grief grows for the man I left behind. Like when you realize a door has been shut for so long, it no longer opens.\n\nI bought a new coat recently, off the street. The day was blindingly sunny, crisp, and cold. Amidst racks of vintage styles, I spotted a brown fur. “Mink,” the salesman explained. It shimmered richly in the afternoon light, like an oil spill. I brushed its sleeve to my cheek, goosebumping at the supple, silky texture. It felt like me in its darkness, its drama, the mild taboo of its material, and the fact that someone probably died in it. Perhaps all the best things are haunted. Perhaps that is the condition of living. McKenna asks me if I “ever commune with X,” explaining how she dialogues with Paul’s memory from time to time. The fact that they’re not physically together is irrelevant. Her question gives my story context—I’ve been communing. Ghosts will always walk among us. Soon, I hope, I can learn to live with mine."
