(And who better to bring the\n\nleopard print revival\n\nto the Oscars than Doja Cat?) The body-hugging strapless dress was outfitted with a deep sweetheart neckline and a flared mermaid train. It was entirely hand-embroidered over the course of 5,600 hours by a team of 46 artisans, who sewed each microbead into an ornate leopard pattern. Beyond the meticulous beading effort, the Balmain atelier worked over two days to ensure that the seams aligned perfectly and no leopard spots were cut off.\n\nDoja added yellow pear-shaped drop earrings from Messika and a matching necklace with a pendant that emerged from beneath her backward scarf.\n\nKevin Mazur/Getty Images\n\nCourtesy of Balmain\n\nA dedicated fan of leopard print, Rousteing has used the motif throughout his tenure at Balmain, from\n\npre-fall 2014\n\nthrough his most recent\n\npre-fall 2025\n\n. This also isn’t the French designer’s first collaboration with Doja Cat. In 2022, the singer performed at\n\nBalmain’s music festival\n\n, which celebrated Rousteing’s 10th anniversary as creative director, and last night the two reunited for this\n\npurr\n\n-fect red carpet look."

Chu’s\n\nWicked,\n\nbut the singer and actor also took to the stage for a\n\nspecial opening performance\n\nwith her co-star, Cynthia Erivo. “We wanted it to be a tribute to Oz, and to the beautiful women and witches who have come before us,” says Grande, who performed a powerful rendition of “Somewhere Over the Rainbow,” as well as “Defying Gravity” with Erivo. “\n\nThe Wizard of Oz\n\n, and especially ‘Somewhere Over the Rainbow,’ has been a very special to me since I was a little girl. My grandpa always asked me to sing it, and it has always been a part of my life, becoming even more meaningful to me over the years.”\n\nWhile Grande captivated the audience with her powerful vocals, she also brought forth Oscar-worthy fashions to match the excitement. Working with stylist Mimi Cuttrell, Grande wore two spellbinding Schiaparelli gowns designed by Daniel Roseberry. “I love Daniel and Schiaparelli more than life itself, so to have been able to share this moment with him and the incredible team for both of my looks, was such a surreal honor,” says Grande. Her carpet look, in the softest Glinda pink, consisted of a satin duchess bustier dress and nude silk-tulle skirt. The silhouette was inspired by an Alberto Giacometti lamp that Roseberry found in the Schiaparelli archives, and it featured over 190,000 crystal sequins, rhinestones, and beads.\n\nPhoto: Katia Temkin"

Still, we couldn’t miss her—thanks largely in part to the fact that she’s wearing her own eponymous label. Beckham donned a charcoal trench coat from her\n\nfall 2024 collection\n\n, which she wore collar up, shielding the lower half of her face from the cold (and the paparazzi).\n\nVictoria Beckham in Paris, March 2025.\n\nMarc Piasecki\n\nThe rest of her outfit was patented Beckham style, too. She contrasted her dark coat with a pair of white wide-legged trousers, tailored to perfection so they hovered just above the ground (skimming her go-to platforms, naturally). She also embraced the color du jour with a double handle oxblood tote bag slung over her shoulder. The sole deviation from her brand were her Bottega Veneta shield sunglasses.\n\nVictoria Beckham in Paris, November 2024.\n\nMarc Piasecki\n\nVictoria Beckham fall 2024\n\nIsidore Montag / Gorunway.com\n\nThe look is\n\nnearly identical\n\nto the one she wore in November—also in Paris.

Qualley, who starred in the best picture-nominated film\n\nThe Substance\n\n, hit the red carpet in a black velvet cap-sleeve Chanel dress with a dramatic low back. While the necklace looked like a choker with a diamond center stone from the front, it also filled the negative space created by her low back dress.\n\nYeoh also tried out the look. Amping up her already electric cobalt Balenciaga couture dress, she draped a Boucheron necklace down her back. Along with an eccentric ear cuff, she wore the brand’s white gold Quatre Radiant Edition High Jewelry tie necklace, which was paved with round, baguette, and princess-cut diamonds.\n\nMargaret Qualley at the 2025 Oscars.\n\nGilbert Flores/Getty Images\n\nMichelle Yeoh at the 2025 Oscars.\n\nANGELA WEISS/Getty Images"

Last evening, Depp was on hand as a presenter, where she introduced the Best Costume Design award; It just so happens that her own film,\n\nNosferatu\n\n, was nominated in the category, thanks to the intricate costuming work of Linda Muir. “I’m thrilled to be able to be there to support the incredible nominees from our film\n\nNosferatu\n\n,” Depp tells\n\nVogue.\n\n“[Costume design is] an aspect of filmmaking that I love so much. I am endlessly in awe of Linda Muir and her incomparable work. I also grew up watching the Oscars every year without fail, which is another reason why I was so excited to be attending. It feels surreal!”\n\nGiven it was such a milestone moment to be attending the Oscars as a first-timer, the star was sure to bring a glamorous look with her to the occasion. As a longtime face of Chanel, Depp looked to the French fashion house for her custom design. She wore a Chanel Couture black floral lace halter dress complete with a peplum, all embroidered with black sequins, crystals, and pearls. “My wonderful stylist Spencer Singer and I really wanted to go classic, pure old Hollywood glamour for this special night. Specifically channeling Marilyn Monroe, Veronica Lake, and all our favorite Hollywood starlets,” says Depp of the inspiration. “We wanted the dress to feel true to that inspiration, but also quintessentially Chanel haute couture.”\n\nPhoto: Tyrell Hampton/Courtesy of Chanel"

For those who may not be caught up in the HSM universe, Hudgens played the role of Gabriella Montez in the 2006 Disney Channel film, and in the 2019 TV series based on the film, Rodrigo played a high schooler named Nini, who auditions to play the role of Gabriella Montez at her school’s musical.\n\nWhile their meeting was likely coincidental, the two actresses’ skin-tight black gowns made for a perfect match.. Rodrigo wore a leather mermaid style while Hudgens, who’s known to make a statement or two at the VF after party (last year she debuted her baby bump paired with a\n\nblingy-belly button piercing\n\n), rocked a thigh-high slit topped off with feathers on the shoulder.\n\nWe wonder what the two stars may have talked about, perhaps a third remake of\n\nHigh School Musical\n\nwhere they’re both in the series? But whatever it was, fans of Disney Channel were in for a heartfelt treat with this reunion."

    "content": "Kim Kardashian\n\ncontinued to flex her vintage prowess at the annual\n\nChanel and Charles Finch Pre-Oscar\n\ndinner last night. The ensemble du jour? Well, it needed to pay homage to the hallowed French house hosting the evening’s event, of course. And Kardashian opted to pull from and reference two seminal Chanel shows in both her glam and garb of choice.\n\nDesigned by Karl Lagerfeld for the\n\nopulent 1992 fall couture show\n\n,\n\nKardashian\n\n’s black gown features a Medusa-style corset with a structured bodice and delicate spaghetti straps, falling into a pleated black silk skirt and chiffon jellyfish underskirt. The dress, which took Chanel’s artisans over 100 hours to make, was\n\noriginally worn on the runway\n\nby supermodel and Chanel darling Helena Christensen. Kardashian and her stylist Dani Levi paired the dress with a silver chained, quilted black Chanel bag and black pumps.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nWhile on the runway, Christiansen wore the dress with a fantastical headpiece by legendary milliner Philip Treacy, Kardashian put her own spin on the look with her glam. She instead chose the Barbirific\n\n1995 fall couture show\n\nas a reference for her hair—and the one and only\n\nClaudia Schiffer\n\n. On the runway, Schiffer’s golden hair was extended to Rapunzel-like lengths and secured with three black bows, and her eyes were lined in exaggerated black liner.\n\nKardashian turned to her go-to team:\n\nChris Appleton\n\nfor hair and MUA Rokael Lizama. “We have had this look on the books for ages and it fit perfectly tonight,” Appleton tells\n\nVogue\n\nexclusively. “We put a more modern spin on it with a middle part and no bangs. The snatched sides with the cheekbones with top part out and middle part more modern and clean without the bangs.”\n\nTo create the look, Appleton says he left the hair from the temple to the crown out, and to contour her face, pulled back the ponytail in line with her cheekbones. “Then, I created the middle part and pulled it back on the sides so it doesn’t pull the forehead, to suit her face perfectly,” he explains. He added three bows and extended her hair to 40 inches long."

Aside from being a model and actor,\n\nEmRata\n\nhas become known for being a certified streetwear head, from all the\n\ndeep-cut trainers\n\nshe wears on dog walks to the sort of\n\npuffer jacket\n\ncollection usually reserved for teenage boys with a monthly allowance and a whole morning to queue.\n\nThis time though, it wasn’t her jacket which had us paying attention—which is weird because it’s so red that it physically could not get any redder. No, it was her\n\njeans\n\n—baggy low-rise in a dark-wash denim, paired with some classic pointy black boots. Clearly, EmRata got the memo about inky-blue denim being the\n\ntrending jean\n\nfor spring.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nLighter washes have been on the outs for a while now. Or, to be more specific, what British\n\nVogue\n\n’s fashion news editor Daniel Rodgers\n\nrefers to as\n\n“the sagging, pallid jeans that have metastasised the out-out wardrobe.” (Yes, there are people wearing baby-blue jeans to the club). Darker denim, however, especially\n\nthe sturdy selvedge type\n\n, can sort of elevate and casualize an outfit at exactly the same time, making them an ideal wardrobe staple for after hours.\n\nEssentially, EmRata is wearing dark-wash jeans exactly as the style gods intended for 2025. “Deep indigo washes, especially those rendered in rigid fabrics, can bring a sense of polish to the otherwise casual staple,” wrote British\n\nVogue\n\n’s Alice Cary towards the end of last year. “Endorsers have taken to wearing dark denim jeans with simple foundational pieces like white shirts and tanks, as well as statement tops and bold knitwear. There are very few things that wouldn’t look good with a pair of inky-blue jeans.” And Emily Ratajkowski sure knows it."

    "time": "February 24, 2025",
    "content": "“I’d like to be blond again,” said a newly brown-haired Toby Hudson Jones.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Toby Hudson Jones\n\nI’m generally anti-algorithm, but sometimes it does come through—as when it started serving up posts from\n\n@beans1_\n\n, a.k.a. Toby Hudson Jones, 22, a model and fashion student at\n\nLondon College of Fashion\n\n. Click on their page, and you’ll find them working a babygirl look in\n\nDazed,\n\ngothing out for Alasdair McLellan in\n\nDust,\n\nand demonstrating how Our Legacy should be worn. Scroll even further, and you’ll see #BeanForCeline—a dream casting (which led to an ad campaign) that Jones almost turned down.\n\nArrow\n\nArrow\n\nBack in 2022, Jones, then working “a really boring minimum-wage job,” was encouraged by a model friend to give posing a chance. “So on the bus on my way to work, I applied to 10 agencies, and\n\nAnti-Agency\n\nwas the only one that replied,” says Jones. “Applying to agencies with purple hair is probably why I didn’t hear back from most places. And then about three months in, I got an email about meeting the Celine team. Typical for me, [my partner and I] had booked this holiday, which I had forgotten about. So I went and agreed to everything, and then once I’d met the team, I remembered, so I was trying to tell them that I wouldn’t be available. I had no idea what I was being optioned for. I don’t think my agency believed me [when I said I was going away]. I mentioned it to my mum, and she called me stupid. Eventually, it clicked what was happening.” Starting at the top seems to come naturally for Jones, a climber. “I’ve got ADHD, so I would climb everything as a child. I was trying to find my way on top of things.”\n\nYou might say that Jones’s style is also top-down; their “ever-changing hair” has been a signature since high school. For their Celine debut it was blue; at this point they say, “I don’t know what my real natural color is.” Another distinctive trait: silver rings (a goat and a claddagh) from\n\nThe Great Frog\n\nand a wardrobe heavy on pieces from\n\nDrop Dead Clothing\n\n, a Sheffield label favored by Billie Eilish and Justin Bieber and founded by Oli Sykes (the lead singer of Bring Me the Horizon, a band Jones was into).\n\nJones in “a Silent Hill–style photo shoot” for Drop Dead\n\nPhoto:\n\nJamie Carmichael\n\n/ Courtesy of Drop Dead\n\nJones in “a Silent Hill–style photo shoot” for Drop Dead\n\nPhoto:\n\nJamie Carmichael\n\n/ Courtesy of Drop Dead\n\nWorkwise, Jones is trying to find a way to maintain their self-image as a nonbinary person in an industry that remains organizationally binary. “A lot of casting people I’ve worked with have been great and super accommodating, and I’ve enjoyed most of the projects, but it’s the structure of how fashion works—it’s very rigid.” Jones is primarily cast for menswear shoots, and while the final results look good, the model says castings “place me back into a masculine role.” One of their school projects was investigating unisex lines; Jones found these to be mostly better in theory than practice. “It’s a lot of taking preexisting items and calling them unisex rather than trying to do something else,” they note. Kim Jones’s work at\n\nDior Men\n\n, with womenswear elements and patterns brought into menswear, was an exception, they say. “It is interesting how one-sided the exchange is between menswear and womenswear,” Jones says. There’s this “idea that menswear silhouettes are potentially unisex and then womenswear is a separate category that can pick and choose what it wants but cannot have anything transferred out of it.”\n\nThe Mancunian found their way to fashion design through a cousin who pursued the same course of study. The third-year student is just wrapping up a placement with Palmer Harding and thinking about focusing on costume: “I’d much rather have something specific that I’m really passionate about and put all my energy into that rather than constantly thinking about the future and what’s next,” says Jones. The dream? To work with Colleen Atwood (\n\nBeetlejuice, The Little Mermaid, Chicago\n\n) one day. Certainly they’d come well prepared: Jones’s mission is to watch at least a film a day this year."

For Kim Jones’ show, Moss wore a white silk dress that played on a button-down, featuring two rows of buttons, an asymmetrical hemline, and a peekaboo black lace bra. She paired the dress with ultra-sheer black tights, black pumps, a heaping stack of mixed-metal bracelets, and a chain necklace. For some extra pizzazz, Moss carried a leopard print bucket bag.\n\nLeaving the Ritz Paris.\n\nDPTIG / BACKGRIDUSA\n\nThe real star of the show, however, was the black faux-fur jacket Moss wore to her London birthday party last week. The eye-catching jacket—with an assist from the leopard print bag—gave Moss’s ladylike outfit a naughty edge. (For anyone still obsessed with reviving the indie sleaze era, let this live on your moodboard.)\n\nWhile we saw this jacket as recently as last week, it’s been a staple in the model’s closet for over 20 years. She’s had it since at least 2003, when she wore it to the Dazed and Confused Exhibition in London.

Luckily, one of fashion’s finest duos—\n\nKate Moss\n\nand her daughter\n\nLila\n\n—are here to show us how it’s done.\n\nThe supermodel and her lookalike daughter took the same brief to heart when choosing outfits for\n\nKate’s 51st birthday\n\nparty at China Tang at The Dorchester. Both mother and daughter stuck to a sexy, all-black dress code, albeit in very different ways. Kate opted for a black top with a plunging neckline embellished with silver sequins, black trousers, and strappy rhinestone sandals. (Lord knows Kate Moss won’t let a frigid London January stop her from wearing an open-toed shoe.) She kept warm with a black furry coat and heaps of jewelry, from an emerald cocktail ring to a miniature tusk necklace.\n\nTwenty-two-year-old Lila, on the other hand, turned to Réalisation Par, a brand popular among her fellow Gen-Zers, for her slinky eveningwear. She wore a black silky bias cut halter dress that fell just below the knee. In a summery touch, a large rose motif was embroidered across the chest, which complemented her open-toe mules.\n\nOne area where the Mosses did choose to match was in the beauty department: both women sported a nude manicure and a red pedicure. “Like mother, like daughter” applies to nail polish choices, right?"

    "time": "February 5, 2025",
    "content": "Throughout his career,\n\nVictor Glemaud\n\nhas looked at what he designs from every angle known to a fashion designer’s eye—until now, that is. When Glemaud, who made his name with curvaceous, size-inclusive, and inventively hued knitwear, started to collaborate with Patterson Flynn on a series of rugs—the company, owned by interiors brand Schumacher, is renowned for its artisanal carpets—he only had to look in one direction: Downward, to floor level.\n\n“You’re designing something that likely will be, in part, covered—whether it’s by a sofa, or a chair, or a coffee table, or whatever,” said Glemaud, who’s making his second foray into interior design with this collection; the first was textiles for Schumacher, and a chance email exchange with them led him to designing the rugs. “What I had to figure out was: How do you get a variation in pattern and color, but also convey the same kind of softness that my knits have? In the end, you don’t want the rug to look or feel flat.”\n\nVictor Glemaud’s terrific sense of color comes to the fore with this his Assine rug in azure.\n\nPhoto: Melanie Acevedo/Courtesy of Patterson Flynn\n\nTo be sure: Glemaud succeeds in achieving the rich dimensionality he was aiming for. If I was unrolling one of Glemaud’s Patterson Flynn rugs in my home, I wouldn’t so much as put a footstool on it. With his mix of geodes and scrolling lines, floral-edged borders, and chevron zig zagging—not to mention his color palette (terracotta, pearl gray, azure, yellow)—I’d be loath to cover any of them. And in a moment when the statement rug can sometimes feel a bit like a bank statement—a dispiriting experience because you know exactly what it’s going to say (or in this case, look like)—Glemaud’s designs have a wit and a warmth which feel zingy and original."

    "content": "Just a few days before\n\nAlessandro Michele’\n\ns inaugural\n\nValentino\n\ncouture show, the Italian designer welcomed\n\nVogue\n\ninto one of the house's five Paris ateliers, where master seamstresses were hard at work putting the finishing touches on his otherworldly designs. “Like every beginning it’s beautiful, it’s exciting, but it’s also stressful,” Michele says of his foray into couture. “The collection is an incredible—for me—exercise of creativity.”\n\nThe world of couture was brand new for Michele, who focused on ready-to-wear during his time as creative director at Gucci. “They work by themselves in a very also secret way that is very fascinating,” he says of the members of his atelier and their intricate process for creating pieces of couture by hand. “I feel myself that I’m learning because this is so different than from being just a fashion designer. I’ve never seen something like this in my life.”\n\nWhen approaching the collection, Michele wanted to consider the world that Mr. Valentino himself inhabited when he helmed the house. The golden age of Italian film served as a major influence—specifically the Cinecittà studio and the works of Luchino Visconti and Frederico Fellini. But while he considers Mr. Valentino’s life experience, Michele views his first couture collection as a conversation between the two of them. “His presence is so big. You must find your way,” Michele says.\n\nIt was of the utmost importance for Michele that his own perspective harmonized with the Valentino house codes. “I think that Mr. Valentino means, for many people, a kind of classical beauty,” he says. “My way to approach beauty is more\n\nsauvage\n\n. I like the wrong things that became beautiful.” The fantastical nature of Michele’s couture—the grandeur, the opulence, even the humor—isn’t lost on him in a particularly dark political moment. “I hope that people are going to leave the room stronger than before.”\n\nWatch here as Alessandro Michele takes\n\nVogue\n\ninside the Valentino atelier ahead of his couture spring 2025 collection.\n\nDirector: Nikki Petersen\n\nDirector of Photography: Fyras Slaiman\n\nEditor: Maxime Garault\n\nSenior Producer: Bety Dereje\n\nAssociate Producer: Lea Donenberg\n\nGaffer: Darius Babled\n\nAudio: David Amsalem\n\nProduction Assistant: Lorenzo Priotto\n\nProduction Coordinator: Ava Kashar\n\nProduction Manager: Natasha Soto-Albors\n\nSenior Director, Production Management: Jessica Schier\n\nPost Production Coordinator: Holly Frew\n\nArt & Graphics Lead: Léa Kichler\n\nSupervising Editor: Erica DeLeo\n\nPost Production Supervisors: Alexa Deutsch, Cyril Delvart\n\nDirector, Post Production: Nicholas Ascanio\n\nDirector, Content Production: Rahel Gebreyes\n\nSenior Director, Digital Video: Romy van den Broeke\n\nSenior Director, Programming: Linda Gittleson\n\nVP, Video Programming: Thespena Guatieri"

The year was 1872 when Enrique Loewe Roessberg gave his name (which translates to “lion”) to the label. By 1905, Loewe had earned the privilege of being an “official supplier to the Spanish Royal Crown.”\n\nThe brand maintained its status as a luxury leather maker, and by the middle of the century, Loewe bags could be seen on the likes of Ava Gardner during a visit to Spain with her then-husband Frank Sinatra. In 1965, Loewe introduced its first ready-to-wear collection, and five years later, the brand enlisted Spanish artist Vicente Vela to develop a logo—the famed anagram of four scrolling\n\nL\n\n’s still in use today.

That is, there’s a less-is-more approach, and you won’t find a brand logo on a single item. Instead, you’ll see an identifiable signature, the intrecciato woven leather treatment, which, since we’re on the subject of languages, translates to\n\nintertwined\n\nin Italian. Furthermore, Bottega Veneta means\n\nVenetian shop\n\n, which brings us right to the beginning….\n\nThe Best Bottega Bags to Shop Now\n\nThe Liberta\n\n- debuted in 2024\n\nThe Parachute\n\n- rereleased in 2024\n\nThe Lauren 1980\n\n- rereleased in 2024\n\nThe Hop\n\n- debuted in 2023\n\nThe Andiamo\n\n- debuted in 2023\n\nThe Sardine\n\n- debuted in 2022\n\nThe Clicker\n\n- debuted in 2022\n\nThe Kalimero\n\n- debuted in 2022\n\nThe Jodie\n\n- debuted in 2020\n\nThe Cassette\n\n- debuted in 2019\n\nThe Pouch\n\n- debuted in 2020\n\nThe Cabat\n\n- debuted in 2001\n\nAn early Bottega Veneta mention in\n\nVogue's\n\nNovember, 1979 issue. Photographed by John Stember.\n\nJohn Stember\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nwas founded in 1966 in Vicenza, Italy, by Michele Taddei and Renzo Zengiaro. The basket-weave technique so famous today was really just a workaround to a technical problem: At the start, the leather-goods company didn’t have sewing machines capable of accommodating thicker swathes of leather, so thin leather was used—but in order to make Bottega\n\nbags\n\nmore durable, the leather was woven at the diagonal. It didn’t take long for the label to go global. By the 1970s, a Bottega Veneta shop had opened up in Manhattan, luring the likes of Andy Warhol, who, in a lesser-known photo, can be seen kissing a Bottega loafer. (In 1985, the Pop artist would also make a short film for the Italian label.) It was also embraced in popular culture: Lauren Hutton memorably carried a brown Bottega clutch in 1980’s\n\nAmerican Gigolo\n\n—a moment that the label paid homage to in 2017 by reviving the bag and bringing Hutton out onto the runway.\n\nAround that time, “When your own initials are enough” became Bottega Veneta’s slogan, hinting at the luxury brand’s\n\nif you know, you know\n\nethos. (This was not a place for monogram canvas fabrications and logomania.) And because it wouldn’t be an Italian heritage label if there weren’t a bit of family drama: In the 1970s, co-founder Zengiaro gave the company to his ex-wife, Laura Braggion, who took the reins alongside her second husband, Vittorio Moltedo. All this went on until 2001, when the Gucci Group (now a subsidiary of Kering) bought up the company and appointed German designer Tomas Maier as creative director. In 2005 came the label’s first ready-to-wear collection, with fragrances, jewelry, sunglasses, home decor, and more categories following soon after. But in lieu of a flamboyant, la dolce vita–style lifestyle brand, Bottega only whispered of luxury. (After a 2006 runway show,\n\nVogue\n\ndescribed Maier’s aesthetic as “\n\nstealth wealth\n\n.”) Maier revived the Knot Box clutch from 1978, introduced the Cabat tote bag, and played a significant hand in reaffirming Bottega’s dominance in the global fashion game after a quiet period in the ’90s.\n\nIn June 2018,\n\nDaniel Lee\n\ntook over the creative directorship of Bottega Veneta and turned the label into one that churned out\n\nIt bag\n\nafter It bag—all without the use of a single logo. Early in his tenure, Lee gave the world the Cassette and the Jodie bag, and the fashion set\n\nstill\n\nhasn’t gotten over it. In the fall of 2021, the Lee-era came to an end after it was announced he would exit his position. Matthieu Blazy, who had a long history of designing for prestigious labels and was at the time designing for Bottega, was promoted to creative director. In the short time Blazy has been at the helm, he’s made his mark. His debut fall/winter collection was met with much fanfare and, as it relates to bags, his contributions of The Sardine and The Clicker have already reached the elusive It bag status—a sentiment that is surely to grow among Bottega fans now that the French-Belgian designer announced his departure in December 2024 to join Chanel as its newest artistic director.\n\nRead on for a history of the most recognizable and best Bottega Veneta handbags.\n\nThe Liberta\n\nBottega Veneta fall/winter 2024\n\nBottega Veneta is a brand that prides itself on its under-the-radar leather goods. This means that no logo can be found on its bags, and hardware is used carefully and sparingly. The Liberta, the Maison’s newest bag, epitomizes this design philosophy with panache. It debuted on the Bottega fall/winter 2024 runway collection in a series of soft and powder colors. This is the one bag that (as of now) is not offered in the signature intrecciato. A celebration of smooth leathers, the Libreta does feature a bit of texture with a braided rope closure that loops around a U-shaped piece of hardware that’s delightfully minimalist—everything you need and nothing you don’t—which is very Bottega, after all. Coming in two sizes, the bag can be worn cross-body, on the shoulder, or, per the models on the catwalk, clutched like a pouch.\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nLiberta medium flap leather crossbody bag\n\n$4,200\n\nBERGDORF GOODMAN\n\n$4,200\n\nNEIMAN MARCUS\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nsmall Liberta leather cross-body bag\n\n$4,200\n\nBERGDORF GOODMAN\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nLiberta medium flap leather crossbody bag\n\n$4,200\n\nBERGDORF GOODMAN\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nsmall Liberta leather shoulder bag\n\n$3,500\n\nNORDSTROM\n\nThe Parachute\n\nBottega Veneta pre-fall 2024\n\nGiven its vast oeuvre of perfect purses, one of Bottega Veneta’s latest styles is the Parachute tote, a rereleased of a beloved style that is crafted from handwoven Intrecciato leather. Named after its ample, roomy body, the Parachute bag has been updated with Bottega's colors du jour and also with the addition of the house’s distinctive metallic knot detail, which you might recognize from the Andiamo bag. The bag comes in two sizes, with its smaller style equipped with a detachable shoulder strap, which can be added for hands-free, crossbody styling.\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nsmall Parachute\n\n$4,150\n\nBOTTEGA VENETA\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nParachute small intrecciato leather shoulder bag\n\n$4,150\n\nNET-A-PORTER\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nParachute large intrecciato leather shoulder bag\n\n$5,900\n\nNET-A-PORTER\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nParachute large intrecciato leather shoulder bag\n\n$5,900\n\nNET-A-PORTER\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nParachute small intrecciato leather shoulder bag\n\n$4,150\n\nNET-A-PORTER\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nParachute small intrecciato leather shoulder bag\n\n$4,150\n\nMYTHERESA\n\nThe Lauren 1980\n\nLauren Hutton carrying the Pouch clutch on the spring 2017 runway in homage to\n\nAmerican Gigolo.\n\nThis is one Bottega bag with a bit of Hollywood history. In the cult-classic film\n\nAmerican Gigolo,\n\nstarring Lauren Hutton and Richard Gere from 1980, Hutton is seen on screen in a slick trench coat. Beneath her arm, a red leather woven bag is tucked. It was indeed a Bottega bag and the on-screen cameo was paid homage to at the Italian label’s spring/summer 2017 show when Hutton herself walked the runway with the bag. Relaunched in Spring 2017, the bag sold out quickly and inspired Blazy years later to re-relaunch the bag in even more colorways and skins. The most recent iteration of the bag is re-colored in Fresh Mint (pale green) and String (soft beige) hues, and the offerings of The Lauren 1980 also go beyond its original pouch construction with chain straps and top handles. The most recent styling is a shoulder bag with a roomy body that, yes, still pairs perfectly with a trench coat.\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nLauren 1980 small intrecciato leather clutch\n\n$3,600\n\nNET-A-PORTER\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nLauren 1980 small intrecciato leather clutch\n\n$3,600\n\nNET-A-PORTER\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nTeen Lauren 1980 with chain\n\n$4,400\n\nBOTTEGA VENETA\n\n$4,400\n\nBERGDORF GOODMAN\n\n$4,400\n\nNEIMAN MARCUS\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nLauren 1980 intrecciato leather clutch\n\n$4,400\n\nNORDSTROM\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nLauren 1980 mini clutch bag with chain strap\n\n$3,600\n\nNEIMAN MARCUS\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nLauren 1980 teen clutch bag with chain strap\n\n$4,000\n\nBERGDORF GOODMAN\n\nThe Hop\n\nBottega Veneta fall/winter 2023\n\nIf the Hop, which debuted on the Bottega Veneta Fall/Winter 2023 collection runway, looks familiar to you, you’re spot on. It’s not only inspired by the shape of a hobo bag created by the house in 2002 but it’s also very much giving Jodie (see below). The difference? This bag is made to be appreciated from all angles with an angular shape constructed with a 3D Intreccio design that can be slung over the shoulder or the arm.

It was a somewhat structured but not boxy (its corners are rounded) calf leather intrecciato accessory that featured brass hardware sculpted into a bow-like knot. The effect is a not-your-grandmother’s ladylike handbag and it’s been dubbed the Andiamo. Italian for “let’s go,” Bottega is here to tell us that the Andiamo is for the wearer who is\n\ngoing\n\nplaces. Currently, the bag comes in three sizes and various earth tones of inky green, chalk white, and full-bodied reds. It’s the latest bag drop from Blazy’s Bottega and it’s only a matter of time before it lands on the arms of the chicest men and women you know.\n\nBottega Veneta medium Andiamo bag\n\n$4,900\n\nBOTTEGA VENETA\n\nBottega Veneta medium Andiamo bag\n\n$4,900\n\nBOTTEGA VENETA\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nAndiamo small intrecciato suede tote\n\n$4,500\n\nNET-A-PORTER\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nlarge Andiamo intrecciato suede top-handle bag\n\n$8,000\n\nSAKS FIFTH AVENUE\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nlong Andiamo intrecciato leather clutch\n\n$2,650\n\nNORDSTROM\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nlong Andiamo intrecciato leather clutch\n\n$2,950\n\nMODA OPERANDI\n\nBottega Veneta fall/winter 2022\n\nThe Sardine\n\nIf there’s a Bottega bag that’s white-hot right now, it’s the Sardine. Curved like The Jodie bag but featuring a rod handle in the shape of a gilt, yes, sardine fish, the bag is crafted with a woven lambskin body. It first debuted on the Bottega Veneta\n\nfall/winter 2022 runway\n\nwhich marked current creative director Matthieu Blazy’s debut. For the occasion, Blazy sent out a collection of handbags that would all go on to mark the new Bottega era and nearly all of them have already become an It Bag. By the autumn of 2022, the bag wound up around the arms of Kendall Jenner and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley; it doubles up as a jewel, according to the brand. And lest you forget, the fish is, after all, quite Italian—there's no chicer summer island destination than Sardinia.\n\nBottega Veneta Sardine top handle bag\n\n$4,200\n\nBOTTEGA VENETA\n\nBottega Veneta Sardine top handle bag\n\n$4,200\n\nBOTTEGA VENETA\n\n$4,200\n\nNET-A-PORTER\n\n$4,200\n\nMATCHESFASHION\n\nBottega Veneta Sardine top handle bag\n\n$4,200\n\nBOTTEGA VENETA\n\n$3,055\n\nSELFRIDGES\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nSardine with chain small intrecciato leather shoulder bag\n\n$4,900\n\nNET-A-PORTER\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nsmall Sardine patent leather shoulder bag\n\n$5,100\n\nNEIMAN MARCUS\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nSardine mini intrecciato leather shoulder bag\n\n$3,400\n\nNET-A-PORTER\n\nBottega Veneta resort 2023\n\nThe Clicker\n\nLovers of the Sardine can’t help but fall for the Clicker. Here, Blazy took the codes of the house—unabashedly understated luxury—and turned it into an accessory that epitomized it. Padded (but not puffy!) lambskin intreccio leather makes up the body of the bag, which is attached to a shoulder strap by elegantly curved brass metal links that recall Elsa Peretti’s supremely sexy nature-inspired jewels. The bag debuted alongside Bottega Veneta’s\n\nresort 2023 collection\n\nand pairs perfectly with the maison’s constantly selling out drop earrings.\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nPipe small intrecciato leather shoulder bag\n\n$5,200\n\nNET-A-PORTER\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nPipe small padded intrecciato leather shoulder bag\n\n$5,200\n\nNET-A-PORTER\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nsmall Clicker intrecciato leather shoulder bag\n\n$5,200\n\nNORDSTROM\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nsmall Clicker intrecciato leather shoulder bag\n\n$5,200\n\nNORDSTROM\n\nThe Kalimero\n\nBottega Veneta spring/summer 2023\n\nIf there’s one bag that aimed to set the tone of Bottega’s Blazy-era, it’s The Kalimero. In an oxblood hue, the bag opened Blazy’s\n\ndebut Bottega collection\n\nand was paired with a simple tank, perfectly baggy jeans, and a pair of woven boots. The look walked the show and swept the room in a delicious breath of fresh air. Cylindrically shaped like a bucket bag, the purse is offered in three main iterations. A version with a loop (meant to be clutched or tossed on the shoulder), a bucket shape with a smaller strap, and a double version for those looking for a bit more storage. Fabrications also range from metallic foil-like silver and buttery calfskin with a slight gloss.\n\nBottega Veneta small Kalimero bag\n\n$7,500\n\nBOTTEGA VENETA\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nsmall Kalimero bag\n\n$7,500\n\nBOTTEGA VENETA\n\nBottega Veneta small Kalimero bag\n\n$7,500\n\nBOTTEGA VENETA\n\n$7,500\n\nSAKS FIFTH AVENUE\n\n$7,500\n\nBERGDORF GOODMAN\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nKalimero plissé intrecciato leather bucket bag\n\n$7,500\n\nNORDSTROM\n\nBottega Veneta Kalimero mini Intreccio bucket bag\n\n$7,300\n\nNEIMAN MARCUS\n\nBottega Veneta Kalimero large leather bucket bag\n\n$9,900\n\nMODA OPERANDI\n\n$9,900\n\nBOTTEGA VENETA\n\nKendall Jenner with the maxi Jodie. Photos: Backgrid\n\nThe Jodie\n\nWhen the Jodie bag was born, it had no name; it was only after a shot of Jodie Foster shielding herself from flashbulbs with a large black Bottega bag that Bottega changed that. The bag, which arrived in stores in early 2020, as part of Bottega’s\n\nresort 2020 collection,\n\nshared many characteristics with Bottega’s classic Hobo bag, only Lee put a knot into the handle to make it his own. The Jodie comes in many sizes— maxi, standard, mini—but is always crafted in an intrecciato leather (except when it’s sheathed in cushy shearling) and made in Italy. Colors range from fuchsia pink to a perfect chocolate color—but there’s really no wrong choice.\n\nBottega Veneta mini Jodie bag\n\n$2,650\n\nBOTTEGA VENETA\n\n$2,650\n\nSAKS FIFTH AVENUE\n\n$2,650\n\nNET-A-PORTER\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nJodie mini knotted intrecciato leather tote\n\n$2,800\n\nNET-A-PORTER\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nBV Jodie leather hobo bag\n\n$4,400\n\nNORDSTROM\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nsmall Jodie bag\n\n$4,400\n\nBERGDORF GOODMAN\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nTeen Jodie shoulder bag\n\n$3,500\n\nSSENSE\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nmini Jodie intrecciato leather bag\n\n$2,800\n\nSAKS FIFTH AVENUE\n\nBottega Veneta pre-fall 2019\n\nThe Cassette\n\nIn Bottega Veneta’s pre-fall 2019 collection, a new bag was introduced. Called the Cassette after its rectangular shape, the crossbody featured an oversized weave, almost as though you were looking through a microscope at the maison’s classic intrecciato. A season later, at the\n\nfall/winter 2019 collection\n\n, models took the runway toting chubby, puffed-up versions of the bag: enter, the Padded Cassette. The fashion world fell hard for that irresistible bag, which Lee eventually remixed with a hulking gold chain strap and, more recently, an assortment of candy-colored leathers and suede fabrications.\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nCassette medium padded intrecciato leather shoulder bag\n\n$4,900\n\nNET-A-PORTER\n\nBottega Veneta Cassette plissé Intrecciato leather crossbody bag\n\n$3,800\n\nSAKS FIFTH AVENUE\n\n$3,800\n\nNORDSTROM\n\nBottega Veneta small Cassette bag\n\n$2,500\n\nBOTTEGA VENETA\n\n$2,500\n\nSAKS FIFTH AVENUE\n\n$2,500\n\nNORDSTROM\n\nBottega Veneta small Cassette camera bag\n\n$2,500\n\nBOTTEGA VENETA\n\n$2,500\n\nNEIMAN MARCUS\n\n$2,500\n\nELYSE WALKER\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nCassette medium intrecciato leather shoulder bag\n\n$3,000\n\nNET-A-PORTER\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nCassette small intrecciato leather shoulder bag\n\n$2,250\n\nNET-A-PORTER\n\nBottega Veneta spring/summer 2020\n\nThe Pouch\n\nDaniel Lee’s first contribution to Bottega Veneta’s handbag oeuvre was a remarkably successful one. The Pouch bag debuted at the label’s spring/summer 2020 collection, and its minimalist design featured a supple calfskin leather gently folded and gathered like a dumpling. An instant hit, the bag now comes in myriad styles: There’s the shoulder pouch with a curved top handle reminiscent of the Jodie (see above), there’s the chain pouch with a glitzy linked strap, the mini pouch which closes with a drawstring, and the intrecciato Pouch. With this bag comes one of those rare moments in fashion history when a wonderfully straightforward accessory ascended to It bag greatness.\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nPouch large gathered leather clutch\n\n$3,600\n\nNET-A-PORTER\n\nBottega Veneta pouch bag\n\n$4,200\n\nBOTTEGA VENETA\n\n$4,200\n\nNET-A-PORTER\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nPouch leather clutch\n\n$4,200\n\nSAKS FIFTH AVENUE\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nsmall Pouch leather clutch\n\n$2,500\n\nNORDSTROM\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nmini Pouch bag\n\n$2,500\n\nBERGDORF GOODMAN\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nPouch leather clutch\n\n$3,600\n\nNORDSTROM\n\nBottega Veneta fall/winter 2024\n\nThe Cabat\n\nThis bag from the Maier era has maintained its allure ever since its debut in 2001. Named the Cabat, it was Maier’s first handbag for Bottega and it kept close to the codes of the house. The Cabat is a sumptuously simple squarish leather bag—woven leather and nothing else. There’s no lining, no zipper, no panels or seams, though there\n\nis\n\na strip of leather at the base of the bag’s interior and a detachable pouchette for additional storage. It’s a shape and style that has been in embraced by both Lee and Blazy; and it’s unlikely it’s going anywhere anytime soon.\n\nBottega Veneta medium Cabat bag\n\n$9,100\n\nBOTTEGA VENETA\n\n$9,100\n\nNET-A-PORTER\n\nBottega Veneta medium Cabat bag\n\n$9,100\n\nBOTTEGA VENETA\n\n$9,100\n\nSAKS FIFTH AVENUE\n\nBottega Veneta Cabat bag\n\n$4,600\n\nBOTTEGA VENETA\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nmedium Cabat bag\n\n$9,500\n\nNEIMAN MARCUS\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nlarge Cabat bag\n\n$10,900\n\nNEIMAN MARCUS\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nCabat large suede tote bag\n\n$5,500\n\nMYTHERESA"

    "title": "What’s Real? What’s True? The Spring 2025 Couture Collections Have the Answer",
    "time": "January 31, 2025",
    "content": "Looking through the\n\nspring 2025 couture collections\n\n, a thought kept running through my mind. “What a great time to be alive if you love the theater of the absurd.” It’s a quote from one of David Lynch’s daily\n\nweather reports on YouTube\n\n, and while he was absolutely\n\nnot\n\nreferring to the spectacle of Parisian high fashion, it does fit the mood quite well.\n\nAt\n\nDior,\n\nMaria Grazia Chiuri explored the history of fashion by imagining she was making clothes for a child or perhaps a doll. The result was an odd mix of saccharine-sweet broderie anglaise bloomers layered underneath panniers, gilded cages-as-skirts, and fringe like so many homemade jellyfish costumes (if your home happens to be made up of the most exacting ateliers in Paris, of course). “Nonsense and fairy tales.\n\nAlice in Wonderland\n\n,” said Sarah Mower in her review. Couture has always been known for being the realm of fantasy. We want to follow designers down their rabbit holes.\n\nNo one knows their way through a rabbit hole quite like Alessandro Michele, whose debut couture collection for\n\nValentino\n\ncame with a 200-page tome of references for each look (if you didn’t feel like reading, the references were also projected on the screen behind each look as the models walked slowly by). He titled the collection Vertigineux, a reference to the dizzying heights to which he pushed himself—and the Valentino atelier—as he put together the collection. “It’s like every single person is like a little wizard, something magical, and everything is under a spell,” he said on the\n\nVogue\n\npodcast\n\n. “Time doesn’t exist. The ritual of making is completely different.” And time did not exist. Just like at Dior, there were panniers—in fact, there were panniers in almost every couture collection this season—a nod to harlequins, luxe Mexican wrestling masks, the vestments of 1980s high society, sober Elizabethan gowns, fringe, ribbons, embroidery, lace, ruffles, jacquards, velvets, patchwork, pleats, and simple harem pants.\n\nReferences to everything mean references to nothing, mean something new. Each model was like a character from a different Cinecittá film; but how is that any different from the way we all get dressed every morning, ready to play our own character: being a worker, a wife, a mother, a daughter; going through our routine like performing lines in a play. Indeed, how much better would it be to go about it all while wearing the red jacket with the curved lapel from Look 24? (It would be the same, but we tell ourselves stories in order to live.)"

    "title": "The Fall 2025 Menswear Trends Paint a Portrait of a Fashion Industry in Flux",
    "time": "January 31, 2025",
    "content": "The menswear trends stemming from the fall 2025 collections this month paint a picture of an industry in transition. Designers often talk about liminal spaces, contrasts, and juxtapositions, and while they often reference their collections and the “tensions” they imbue their clothing with in their quest for novelty, they seldom discuss these same concepts in the context of the industry at large. But fashion is at the threshold of change with 2025 being a year of big debuts: Matthieu Blazy at Chanel, Haider Ackermann at Tom Ford, Sarah Burton at Givenchy, Michael Rider at Celine; plus the just-now announced Glenn Martens at Margiela and Peter Copping at Lanvin, who it fell on to go first as the closing show of the menswear season.\n\nMuch anticipated as they are, these new configurations are due to kick off with the ready-to-wear collections in Paris this coming March. Even Copping’s first outing at Lanvin technically occurred after every other menswear show had happened. This feeling of expectancy, of curiosity and speculation for the changes that are to come in the industry—together with the fires in Los Angeles, a ceasefire in Gaza, and an undeniable anxiety fueled by Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration, which coincided with the start of the Paris leg of shows—has morphed this men’s season into one of trepidation and ambiguity. There was also the fact that many of the usual headliners were missing in action: Jonathan Anderson skipped the men’s season at both JW Anderson and Loewe, Gucci is returning to co-ed, as is Valentino, and Fendi, which is currently missing a womenswear and haute couture artistic director, will showcase a unified fall vision under Silvia Venturini Fendi next month coinciding with its centennial.\n\nThe effect this had on the collections was most evident by the safety and commerciality of the majority of offerings. Designers from Junya Watanabe to Chitose Abe at Sacai and Eli Russell Linnetz at ERL leaned into utility and gorpcore, offering tried and true technical outerwear with collaborations in the space still abounding (Watanabe partnered with Filson, Abe with Uggs). After two spectacular and declarative protest-cum-runway shows for spring, Rick Owens presented a parade of undiluted yet undeniably market-ready Owens-isms from tiny athletic shorts and easy knits to cropped shearling jackets; this focus on the waist was also seen at t Jacquemus, EgonLab, Dolce & Gabbana, and rising cult-favorite Auralee with more cropped proportions plus nipped-waist tailoring, cummerbunds, and lots and lots of belting (from double straps to shoestring cinching).\n\nWhen Vogue Runway asked a range of menswear experts to\n\npredict the direction of men’s fashion\n\nearlier this year, most forecasted a focus on elegance: Such rang true in collections by Alexandre Mattiussi for Ami, Mike Amiri, Kim Jones for Dior Men, and Copping’s Lanvin. While this is the first men’s season in some time in which no dominating tailoring silhouette has emerged, designers did agree on softening the dress shirt with draped blouses, and embraced the ’70s either in proportion (Amiri, Saint Laurent) or in fabrication with velvety styles (Willy Chavarria, Hermès, Dolce & Gabbana). There was also fur, lots of it and in all its configurations: Real or faux, from raw, feral-looking draped pelts at Prada, Sacai, and Emporio Armani to trims and accents most everywhere else. Menswear finds itself iterating between the progressive and contemporary mileage it has gained over the past decade and the conservative and traditional codes of elegance that continue to perform in the market."

    "title": "Viva la Diva: Meet Danish Style Star Siggy Sonne",
    "time": "January 28, 2025",
    "content": "Photographed by Acielle/ Style Du Monde\n\nA 21 year-old Dane with elfin charm,\n\nSiggy Sonne\n\nis a model, stylist, muse, self-described diva, and lead singer of the band\n\nFame Hunter\n\n. Based on his daily routine, it seems fair to add fashion obsessive to that list: Sonne’s morning routine is watching fashion shows and sourcing vintage online while enjoying a coffee. His most recent score was a pair of Prada’s spring 2011 sunglasses with baroque arms; his favorite shows “are always Karl Lagerfeld for Chanel,” with\n\nspring 2005\n\nand\n\nfall 2009\n\ncouture topping the list.\n\nWhen we Zoom, Sonne is at a friend’s house for dinner, cocktail in one hand, phone in the other. His hair is scraped back and he is wearing a cropped jacket in black and white with gold buttons up the front—sort of a\n\nMetropolitan\n\nvibe without the chintz. “My personal style,” Sonne says, like is a classy, rich woman from the Upper East Side, or the 16th arrondissement Paris, very the Karl Lagefeld Chanel girl. I’m into the ’60s right now—little mini dresses and little jackets—but then I love to mix it up, because I also have this rock thing—indie sleaze and this whole ’00s New York underground style.” The glam aspect of Sonne’s style carries over into Fame Hunter’s sound, which he describes as “electronic Pop Music-inspired late ’00s [music] like Glass Candy and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs,” as well as “the bands under the Italians Do It Better label.”\n\nSiggy Selfie: Comme des Garçons jacket and shorts; Fidan Novruzova heels\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Siggy Sonne\n\nSiggy Selfie: Thrifted T-shirt; All-In boots\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Siggy Sonne\n\nMusic runs in the family—Sonne’s mother sings and his father is the drummer in Denmark’s popular rock band D-A-D (Disneyland After Dark)—and he took to the performative aspects of fashion easily. Signed to Scoop, Sonne has been modeling since 14, after appearing in a local magazine with his mom. “I’m obviously not that tall, but I used to be a professional dancer, so I know how to move my body and I know how to walk,” notes the Dane who is a favorite of indie brands like\n\nNicklas Skovgaard\n\nand\n\nBonnetje\n\n. These days, Sonne notes, “I’m picky. I only do the jobs I want to do.”\n\nWhen it comes to working with\n\nAll-In\n\n, the Paris-based independent label, it was co-founders Benjamin Barron and Bror August Vestbø who did the picking. In 2022, after graduating from high school, Sonne moved to Paris to pursue his fashion dreams—which lie not in design, but in art direction. Familiar with\n\nAll-In\n\nmagazine and seeing that they had a show coming up, Somme DMed the duo to ask if he could attend their spring show. Initially he was invited to join the waiting list, but “the next day they asked me if I wanted to walk the show…. it was really random.”\n\nAll-In, spring 2024 ready-to-wear\n\nPhoto: Pascal Gambarte / Courtesy of All-In\n\nAll-In, spring 2023 ready-to-wear\n\nPhoto: Pascal Gambarte / Courtesy of ALL-IN\n\nSimilarly out-of-the-blue was the formation of Fame Hunter, which started out as a fake band. One of Sonne’s friends,\n\nCecilie Jørgensen\n\n, founder of the now shuttered label Icon Visions, was tapped to interpret the Adidas Superstar in her own way. Having chosen a music video format, she needed a band, for which she recruited Sonne (vocals),\n\nHeva Vaupel\n\n(guitar), and\n\nMads Bergland\n\n(production). They wrote a song, “Low Moral Superstar,” for what was supposed to be a one-off project, and then penned a few more for a live performance for the launch event. To everyone’s surprise, Fame Hunter started getting bookings, and now they have an EP dropping in May. At Skovgaard’s fall show, they’ll perform a new song inspired, Sonne notes, by\n\nVersace’s spring 2008\n\nshow."

    "content": "Editor’s note: With two weeks to go until the next round of men’s collections, I updated our spring menswear trends with looks from the ready-to-wear shows.\n\nPutting together a trend report is a most daunting task. How to summarize months of work and countless looks—plus all the front-row chatter—into one list? After the\n\nspring 2025 menswear collections\n\n, the project was even more challenging. What does one make of a season of contradictions?\n\nWith the\n\nOlympics\n\ntaking place in Paris this month, the men’s shows were immediately followed by couture, effectively turning Paris into a two-week fashion marathon. It was go, go, go all the time, a pace not helped by the closed metro stations, ludicrous traffic, and a perceptible undercurrent of anxiety. That talk in the front row? It was often about just how few designers are making money and the world crises amidst which fashion strains for relevance.\n\nOn the runways what we saw was push-pull between magnitude and intimacy. A year after his debut show at\n\nLouis Vuitton\n\n, Pharrell Williams took over the UNESCO Headquarters courtyard for a massive display about togetherness, while\n\nKim Jones\n\nplaced giant sculptures by the ceramicist Hylton Nel on his runway, where he sent out a sweater with the embroidered message “Dior for my real friends.”\n\nRick Owens\n\n, ever the disruptor, staged a spectacle of epic proportions—we saw 10 looks, each repeated 20 times, on a total of 200 models—that was, at its core, a conversation about intimacy. Its vastness made one feel both small and present. “We’re trying to give people options to what are standard conventional ideas of aesthetics,” Owens said. “If we can blur the lines and make people consider other things, maybe that can lead to blurring the lines in consideration of how people treat each other.” My seatmates all cried."
